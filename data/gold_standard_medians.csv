t1_c95k50u,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,Give me time god damn it!   E: this was posted while i was drafting my wall of text.
t1_c95k75v,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I somewhat agree but I'm going to take a shot anyways. Perhaps I can get you to share in my ambivalence.  First some background stuff: There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding tort law (the law of civil liability) and I want to clear up some of the more common ones. (This would be a fruitless endeavor if we weren't starting on the same page.) Am I safe in assuming that:  1. You are not a lawyer, and 2. Your idea of what liability of law is comes from the waivers we have to sign when we go Scuba diving, parachuting, and mountain climbing?  Many of the provisions under those disclaimers are for CYA purposes only. Chances are, if someone tried to sue for most of the things covered under such a waiver they wouldn't win anyways, the cost of adding in such a provision is so cheap (the cost of a few extra peices of paper and ink) that companies feel its worthwhile to do so, in case they get an irrational jury or something.   The effect of this is that the boundaries of what might actually create liability are actually far, far narrower than what you might think just from reading the waivers.    That being said: I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making on two ground.  ********  First -- I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making with the fact that in all jurisdictions I know of, the defendant in a lawsuit for negligence has the defense of **comparative negligence**.   That is to say, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff was negligent and that contributed to his injury, the defendant may be relieved of some or all of his liability, depending on the degree of the plaintiff's negligence compared to that of the defendant.  Many states have the rule where if the plaintiff was even one iota negligent, the defendant is completely relieved of ANY liability regardless of how negligent he was. This is called **contributory negligence** and it's a little more controversial. (For the reasons you mention, I am ambivalent as to which is the better rule.)  Part two incoming (because apparently people are getting impatient). "

t1_c95tixb,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"So basically, whether incentives from assigning liability actually in fact influence behavior -- because among other reasons people have imperfect perceptions of how responsibility is distributed?

t1_c95l4my,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Quick note on the hot coffee case.   * The coffee was hot enough to fuse the plaintiff's labia closed.   * The coffee was so hot because McD's found out it could save money by serving to coffee too hot to be drinkable (so customers would take longer drinking it, and use less of the free refills).  * The plaintiff originally asked only for enough money to cover her medical expenses, but McD kept dicking her around. Part of the reason why the jury awarded the amount it did because it thought McD treated the woman unreasonably after she was injured.   http://www.social.mtu.edu/faculty/speters/WrightsMcDonaldsfacts.htm"

t1_cm5mwyw,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"hello friend, i went to nasa camp.  It was based in florida, it occured in the 1980's  i do not now recall if it was an official nasa thing, dad is dead, mom would say it was official no matter what.  we did a lot of space things, we did see some official rockets, we were on an official nasa campus.  it was a terrible waste of money.  I don't know what space camp is like, but Nasa camp was a continuation of high school, the cool kids and athletes had their representatives, the nerds and the ostracized had theirs. It was no different. we had some ""space"" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.  I don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.  the education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the ""experience space training"" was basically rides we could only go on twice.  the gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3415/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)   [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http://www.allaboutent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gyroscope-ride.jpg)   the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_64wjUxIOxTc/TNAuIK0CqZI/AAAAAAAAAUA/AjHjkse2HSI/s400/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun.    we met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee/human waste catcher and played a ""prank"" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.  obviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it  we were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days  when i went home, i told my parents it was great.  even as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.    I feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.  we spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing.    Maybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.  i believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team.     i don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.  i don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste.    tl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a ""i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value."
t1_cm5nasq,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"∆  Wow, that convinced me that at the very least, the Florida one sucked. I was actually more into the idea of going when I was the age to go to the 11-14 year-old camp, not the one for high school kids, but I'd imagine it wasn't a lot different.  If it's any help to know this, if you went to Cape Canaveral, Florida it was probably an official Space Camp."
t1_cm5niv6,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,"cape carnivale, that was it alright.  fucking space camp. seriously.   the waste disposal / pee catch prank was really what turned me on the whole thing   the ""cool kids"" used that to mock everyone else for the whole rest of the trip and then they used it when we got back to our school for a few months after ""10 gags rubbed some dudes shit container on his face""   fucking hell.   i would be interested if this was scripted or if it was just a shitty presented who did this to us.  if anyone else has gone.   truly curious at this point looking back.   i ran some architecture tours in chicago in early 2000 for extra money, the script was memorized and written before hand for everyone to read, even the jokes and puns i bet the shit on the face gag was too.

t1_cm5nwf0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"I know you said Mobile, AL but do you mean the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL? I went there in middle school. I thought it was fun. I went on a school trip. I'm not sure I can call it a field trip because I'm from Indiana and we went over the weekend. The group of students who went were people who wanted to go so it wasn't for a class. On the trip we buddied up with someone else and that person ended up being a good friend of mine throughout high school and I still keep in touch with him (I am one year out of college).   Having said all of that can you say that your trip would have ended up the same way or better? My enjoyment was due to the school trip and buddy system that was complete luck in it's pairing of myself and my friend. I also only remember two things about the entire weekend trip, which probably totals 20 minutes. My area of study and my career do not reflect an early interest in space or rocketry. Considering all of this, it is a nice memory but I cannot say my life is enriched by the experience. I have an interest in space now but that comes from other areas such as Neil Tyson, sci fi movies, and recent scientific events.  I'm not saying it sucked back then like you want me to say but apparently it wasn't that great because I don't remember all that much about it. If your interest in science is making you reflect and wish that you went (you don't really give a reason), there are ways to get similar effects. Go to the National Air and Space museum in D.C. and watch an educational film in iMAX and there's most of Space Camp right there."
t1_cm5nyuj,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"I'm not up to writing anywhere near as in depth as /r/10gags did, but I'll give you my take.  I went to Space Camp in the late 80s (88?) in Huntsville. It was boring.  You only got to do a tiny bit of what you hoped and only a few kids got to do the fun stuff (and only for a few minutes).  Spending a day walking through the museum was the best part by a large margin.  I still enjoy that when I pass through Huntsville.  To put this into perspective, I entered a trivia contest at DragonCon in the late 90s.  I tied for 2nd with two others.  The top 3 got to have a play off with the top prize being a trip to adult Space Camp.  The 4th place prize was a $50 gift certificate to a local used bookstore.  I volunteered to take 4th because I preferred the gift certificate to the trip (and the second and third prizes)."
t3_1pg4zf,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Regifting is the action of giving someone a gift that was once given to you as a gift. It's usually done when the regifter doesn't have a use, want, or need for the item and/or thinks that another person would like it.  The problem is that, generally speaking, if at any point it's revealed that the gift you gave someone was a regift, it suddenly cheapens the quality of the gift and can even be taken as an insult to the recipient.  I can understand how it might reflect a cheap nature on the part of the gift-giver, but I think that if a regift really reflects one's belief that the recipient would like and value the gift, it mitigates the means to which the giver initially got it. "
t1_cd2oaft,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"After posting, I did some research, and it doesn't seem like many people have as negative an opinion on general regifting as I thought, which kind of nullifies my assumed premise in the first place (that it's never acceptable). Like you said, the exceptions to the general trend seem to be acceptable, which in itself already opposes my posted view.  But I also think it's a good point that you mentioned how it can disrespect the intentions of the person who initially gave the gift first. Point is, you earned a ∆. (which, holy shit, you already have so many!)"

t1_cd2ssov,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,"The fact that the pencils were regifted was sort of a huge insult, especially since they still had someone else's name on it. It showed that the person who gave it to me didn't put enough thought into the gift to even remove information that it was regifted, they just grabbed something and handed it over. It's the thoughtlessness in that instance that made it offensive.   If you don't want to advertise regifting, you can say something like ""when I saw this I thought of you"" and to me, the thought is stated and overt. Just remember to take off all the gift tags first :D "
t3_2x4qkh,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"At the end of his life, Joe Paterno was infamously and unavoidably tied to the horrific allegations made against his long time assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. In a very public trial, Sandusky was convicted of 52 counts of sexual abuse against children. Investigations into the behaviors and attacks made by Sandusky revealed that much of the sexual abuse occurred over a long period of time often at and inside the University's facilities. Graduate assistant coach Mike McQuery even reported to Paterno that he had witnessed Sandusky anally raping a boy. In time Paterno did forward the report to his higher ups however the situation was almost completely kicked under the rug.  As the unheralded leader of the Penn State campus it was Joe Paterno's joint responsibility to address the Sandusky issue and report it to the proper police authorities. For whatever reason he did not do this. There is no conceivable way that Paterno was completely in the dark in regards to Sandusky. He created a lot of good during his lifetime however in my mind he is guilty of a heinous crime that vastly overshadows any NET good he may have created.  Baseball player Alex Rodríguez on the other hand is notoriously known for his use of Performance Enhancing Drugs. With the help of these drugs he became a powerhouse of an athlete capable of putting up incredible batting statistics. Rodríguez and other players' use of PEDs were undeniably responsible for tarnishing the legacy of the sport.  I believe both men deserve maligned legacies. However Paterno's actions were the worser of two evils. He was considered an ethical leader to thousands of people. Rodríguez hurt a sport were as Paterno allowed for the actual physical and mental hurt of children and when given a chance to make amends he failed to do so. "
t1_cowyuji,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"Your synopsis is close, but not entirely accurate - at least not according to the testimony and reports that exist in the matter.  Here's what's not questonable - that the system failed multiple victims at multiple times. People that had a responsibility to report the incident (including Paterno) arguably did not do enough to 1) ensure that these incidents were properly investigated and 2) ensure that Sandusky did not continue to have unfettered access to victims.  However, let's talk about the things that are questionable. People that arguably had the same (or a greater) requirement to report the incident in question were contacted by McQuery both before and after he met with Paterno.   Now, let's talk about some things that weren't largely addressed in the media. Sandusky was not acting as a University official at the time of the incidents - he was acting as an official for the Second Mile, a charity organization that he himself founded. He used his access to the University to further the goals of this organization, but he was not a University employee - Paterno was not his boss and neither was Tim Curley. Despite this, both Paterno and Curley contacted superiors in regards to the incident (Paterno met with Curley the day after McQuery met with him; Curley met with Univeristy President Graham Spanier the day after that).   Curley banned Sandusky from University facilities and also contacted the CEO of the Second Mile - the man who **was** Sandusky's boss, and comprised him of the incident. His response? He told Sandusky to wear shorts in the shower.  Now, let's talk about the fact that *multiple people did not report the incident to law enforcement, despite a requirement to do so*. Within the entire chain, there are at least a dozen individuals who were apprised of a potentially criminal incident that should have contacted authorities, and yet they didn't.   At least three of Paterno's supervisors, Sandusky's boss at the Second Mile, and two board members from that organization had been informed about the incident.  But that's not all - a totally separate incident that went through an entirely separate chain of supervision (OPP - the division of the University responsible for maintenance) *had the same result.*  Doesn't this point to a more systematic problem? One that perhaps goes beyond a single football coach? Isn't it possible that Paterno did what he thought was his responsibility, just like a dozen other people that were made aware of the incident?"
t1_cg5uill,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt; things matter again now  Another good example of things mattering is Chevy's goodbye episode - the polygraph episode. It was similar to Intro to Felt Surrogacy in that each character had secrets that would upset the others and all those secrets were put on the table throughout the episode. In Felt Surrogacy, the secrets they each hold are of very different magnitudes. Troy started a 50 acre fire, while Jeff bailed on a date and felt bad about it. Everyone treats their secrets as if they have the same weight to them, and at the end they have a very sappy ""aww, we can all feel better about this now"" moment. In Cooperative Polygraphy each person's secret is given the appropriate weight. There character's secrets aren't just about things they did, but things they did to each other. There isn't a final moment of sappy sitcom closure where all the harm is undone and everyone hugs. Instead they grow as people. They realize that they're not as nice as they all might think of themselves being. Things mattered this time around. "

First off was consistency.  during the whole season people were complaining about what happened to X or Y.  the one i remember was abed finding a girl he got along with.  and then we never heard about her again.  that kind of thing really bugs fans.    then just the type of humor.  It was simpler, more in your face etc.  Now that type of humor isn't bad, a lot of people like it, but part of why i liked community in the first place was the humor.  changing that to me makes it noticeably worse.    lastly i'll just briefly mention the tone.  a lot of it seemed more light heart-ed and not as heavy as some of the other seasons.  i remember episode one abed said ""that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me"" after jeff said ""i see your value now""  while it sounds funny at first that is some dark shit.  i don't remember anything like this from the fourth season.  this might just be my selective memory of the earlier seasons at the time though.    now there were things they did that i think were better than all the other seasons, but overall my view of it is less than the others."

But try this, make a list of the top 10 episodes. What is the highest you'd have from S4? Off the top of my head from the first 3 seasons you have Paintball, the Bottle ep, the Xmas claymation, Halloween zombies, Paintball II, D&amp;D, the video game ep, and the alternate universe ep. Nothing from S4 comes to mind.  Of course comedy is subjective but I don't think S4 has a single ep worthy of a top 10 and would be lucky to have one or two in the top 20. At the same time if we did a bottom 10 it wouldn't be all S4 or even half S4 so it isn't as bad as some make it.

If it was a close fight then things like title defenses, and success against the mutual opponents certainly come into play. But we watched him get utterly dominated in one round by someone you are raking well below him. It doesn't make much sense to me.  The fact is the heavyweight division has been had long stints of weakness. That's the only reason a man as small as couture was ever able to compete there at all."
t1_cs8wghl,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I would say that Fedor was GOAT heavyweight in any promotion based on his legendary win streak, something I doubt anyone will ever come close to in UFC.  However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.  Cain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.  Couture has more wins in title fights than Cain, especially if you consider his lhc reigns.  Would you consider Couture above Cain?  "
t1_cs8ywso,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"First round finishes are commonplace at Heavyweight.  As previously mentioned, Cain has been KO'd in considerably less time.  Granted my analogy is far from perfect, especially considering it's two different sports.

Then again Lesnar wasn't exactly in perfect condition either, and many considered Ali past his prime even post suspension. He certainly looked less fit.   Lesnar wasn't too old to fight. And Ali was past his prime post suspension, he was still good, but his speed was noticeably reduced. I think your manner of fighting style effects how reduced your capacity is with age. Speedsters seem more vulnerable than brusers to these effects. "
t3_2cy7r8,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,"In the TV show Viking, Season 2 episode 7, Ragnar Lothbrok (blood ealges)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_eagle] Jarl Borg is response to his massive attack on Kattegat, and attempted murder of his family while Ragnar was in England. I believe this was absolutely justified on Ragnar's part. Ragnar had to show King Horik (who was plotting to betray him... and kill his family) that such an assault simply would not be tolerated. He had to show those who wanted to do him in what would happen. Further to this, it showed the people of Kattegat how far Earl Ragnar would go to protect them from an invader.

t3_34yo0h,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"**Obviously, spoilers below.**  I'm watching BSG my first time through right now and just finished the mutiny arc, when Gaeta and Zarek were executed. The last three episodes, I've been sitting here and thinking to myself... I actually sympathize with most of the mutineers, except Zarek because of that scumbag move he pulled on the Quorum of Twelve.  But besides Zarek, doesn't it make perfect sense why people on the ship would revolt? Think about it.  - The fleet has been desperately searching for a home for years now. Roslin and Adama explicitly promised the people that they had mystical visions from the Gods and would find a livable planet. Well, Earth turned out to be a bust. In the people's eyes, it's completely legit to think that Roslin was basically stringing them along fraudulently by pretending to be endowed with wisdom from the Gods. Not only is it heresy, it's a poor way to run a government and maintain a presidency.  - There's a fucking Cylon baseship sitting right squat in the middle of the fleet. Imagine if you were a bunch of Jews hiding in the forest from the Nazis for several months, eating grubs to survive and having to deal with memories of SS officers murdering your mothers/spouses/babies back home. Then out of nowhere, a few SS officers (including a gas chamber operator) show up. They've angered their own leadership and are now on the run from the government. They offer you weapons as a peace offering and then ask that you make nice and happy with them. Who in the right minds would be okay with this? If I was a Jew in that group and my leader made a deal with the gas chamber operator, I would be pissed off beyond belief.  - Admiral Adama seems to be considering the people's opinion less and less as time goes on. The latest situation was the last straw. When captains objected to having Cylons walk around and install upgrades on their ships, his response was essentially ""Fuck you, get in line"". And Roslin was too busy sitting around cooking dinner for the Admiral to actually, oh I don't know... do her duty as President and rally support for her cause.  With all that in mind, I was hoping that Gaeta would actually take control and do things different. Again, Zarek gets no sympathy from me. Having him onboard as a ringleader was one of the biggest mistakes the mutineers made. But everyone else seemed completely legitimate and justified.  "

t1_cqzdpbc,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"First off, let me state it's been a while since my last viewing, so forgive me if I mistake details.  That said-  &gt;Well, Earth turned out to be a bust. In the people's eyes, it's completely legit to think that Roslin was basically stringing them along fraudulently by pretending to be endowed with wisdom from the Gods. Not only is it heresy, it's a poor way to run a government and maintain a presidency.  This is true, which is why real world politicians tend to not make grand promises of what they will accomplish, but rather what they will fight for- with no guarantee of delivery.  Her campaign was run purely on hopes and dreams, and more than a few politicians have seen the end of their careers when they failed to deliver those.  Failure of this magnitude is a justifiable reason to seek a change in president, regardless of how realistic the goal is.  &gt;Who in the right minds would be okay with this? If I was a Jew in that group and my leader made a deal with the gas chamber operator, I would be pissed off beyond belief.  This is an illogical response, one born of emotion rather than reason.  Understandable, but not justifiable.  They are offering badly needed aid, that you arguably may not survive without.  It could be suicide to dismiss them, meeting them with violence could be costly, and trusting them explicitly would be unwise.  Therefore the rational solution is to accept their aid, but monitor them closely and limit their movement until you can be sure of their trustworthiness.  I believe that Adama satisfied these conditions in the initial standoff when they arrived.  Their interaction with the fleet was limited, and Galactica positioned itself with a lethal response ready at all times until their trust was earned by way of the testimony of trusted allies and deeds done by the Cylons.  Even then Adama was reluctant, but was pressed by circumstance to accept them.  Mind you, this is how they handled Athena when she returned with Helo.  &gt;Admiral Adama seems to be considering the people's opinion less and less as time goes on. The latest situation was the last straw. When captains objected to having Cylons walk around and install upgrades on their ships, his response was essentially ""Fuck you, get in line"". And Roslin was too busy sitting around cooking dinner for the Admiral to actually, oh I don't know... do her duty as President and rally support for her cause.  Very true.  At that point, their government bore little resemblance to a democracy and looked much more like a dictatorship, though I would argue this was necessary given the fragility of the fleet and responsibilities of its admiral.  Despite it's deeply negative stigma and undemocratic nature, martial law is not without its merits when used responsibly.  Now here comes the part where I disagree with you- mutiny was not the answer.  I will admit that mutiny is a justifiable means in certain scenarios, but this was not one of them.   * Firstly, Adama's actions were (mostly) neither unreasonable nor without their own justifications, which as I recall was communicated to the fleet.  His unofficial reign after Roslin's unofficial abdication was also very short before the mutiny, which was orchestrated by people with a long-standing grudge (Zarek and Gaeta).  * Secondly, the primary spark was the presence of the Cylons who made every effort to be valuable to the fleet and nonthreatening.  As I said above, violent opposition to their presence was irrational.  * Third, Adama and his loyalty had been proven multiple times at this point, having saved the fleet more times than anyone can count, and his judgement has proven sound throughout their years on the run.  The sudden change of opinion in the fleet was ignorant of this.  While it's not really reasonable to say he should never be doubted, it should have given far more pause than the colonists gave.  * Finally, mutiny was a potentially self-destructive action.  Given the precarious position the fleet was in, a mutiny could have resulted in unnecessary loss of life (it did), loss of critical ships/resources/infrastructure, permanent damage to the survivability of the fleet and, by extension, the human race.  **TL;DR**, Given the risks, Adama's track record, and irrational motivations, I find that while mutiny was not without cause, it was unjustified as a solution, especially above other options.  -edit- words, etc."

t1_cf6guot,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"Dexter season eight is awful.  It is so bad, that if there were a real life Dexter his first priority would be murdering everyone responsible for the travesty of season eight.  And I weep daily that there is not a real life Dexter.  I am going to mention some events from the season.  I'm not calling these ""spoilers"" because that would imply that there was something to spoil.  Instead, I'm calling these ""saviors"" because I hope it ruins the plot and saves someone else from wasting their time with this idiotic show.  Lets start with what a good show is.  Dexter is a ""Dark Drama"" - and what I expect from this kind of show is, in a metaphor, a killer whale.  The whale is sleek and smooth in the same way that the show should be viscerally.  The whale is dangerous and the show should take risks and push boundaries.  The whale is subtle, a four and a half ton animal swimming at thirty miles an hour under the calm surface of the water - until the whale decides to let you see his dorsal.  The archetypal scene of season eight, was the one with Hanna McKay and that private detective on the bus.  Hanna injects the detective and tells him ""I've just given you a sedative, you'll wake up in a couple hours"".  Why did she say this?  I'll go through a few possible reasons.  1. The character would have?  No.  Absolutely not.  Hanna is a subtle poisoner.  Announcing on a crowded bus, and in the company of a child, that you have just poisoned someone is not only reckless and idiotic (we know how this poison works, the guy is already zonked out, she is explaining to no one), but it is also anathema to her character.  She would want to keep things quiet and secret.  2. The viewer needed the exposistion?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Someone entirely unfamiliar with the series, watching that clip on mute would have been able to tell the relevant details.  She injects the guy, he passes out, she escapes.  Yup.  Plus, the Dexter viewer is intimately familiar with how this poison works.  3. The show wants to make it painfully clear that Hanna (despite being a serial killer) isn't killing the guy now that she is a love interest.  Sadly, this is the correct answer.  At this point, the show has been neutered.  Any kind of danger or risk taking in terms of plotting elements is gone.  Hanna is the good person now, only doing good things.  She would never kill anyone and the show will use retard gloves to pointless drive that into you.  Contrast this with the scene in Breaking Bad were Lydia comments that there is only a single packet of Stevia remaining.  This scene feels like the lurch of an unexplained ripple beneath your life raft in the midst of still waters.  Dexter season eight is like they ranked all the Dexter fanfiction that existed and then decided to film one, but they accidentally chose from the bottom of the list instead of the top.  Where once the show was clever, it became bumbling and hamfisted.  Dexter can't do anything right.  Constantly failing to kill people he should, making mistakes, never learning from his actions.  Oh, taking this boy murderer under your wing now buddy?  HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES HAS THAT FAILED FOR YOU BY NOW?  Wants to kill Hanna, can't.  Wants to kill so and so.  Can't.  Wants to blah blah blah.  The narrative is clumsy and jagged.  The motivations of characters reverse for no real reason.  Deb wants to kill Dexter all of a sudden.  Nope, changed her mind, helping him again.  Now she is dead.  Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!  The show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.  I didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny."
t1_cf6jm5k,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,Great answer. What do you think happened that caused season eight to be so poorly done?
t1_cf6qwoo,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Fully endorsing /u/electricfistula's great answer, and adding on.  Season 8 never felt like a final season.  So many new characters were introduced, just to be killed off.  Dr. Vogel's character, while brilliantly played by Charlotte Rampling, made no fucking sense.  Her connection to Dexter and Harry is ludicrous.  At no point in the series was she even hinted at.  To me, it was clear that the writers never envisioned this aspect of Dexter's myth when they created the show and the character, it was purely forced into place for this one season.      The other new characters also seemed to only be introduced to be killed so that the characters we've all come to know get to live (save Deb, who dies because of a one in a million blood clot- just so she and Dex can have one last conversation while she's in the hospital).  No other arc is closed.  Angel, Quinn, and Matthews are still in the dark about who Dexter really was.  This makes LaGuerta's death even more pointless than it already seemed.  Jamie still hasn't done anything important.      Those things plus Dexter and Hannah turning into bumbling idiots as already pointed out turned the last season into a disaster.  The other HUGE GAPPING hole that was never addressed in either S7 or S8 was the scene in S5 where Deb walks in on Dexter and Lumen about to kill Jordan Chase (they can't see each other because of a opaque tarp) and Deb lets them go.  Suddenly Deb finds out Dexter is a serial killer and has this huge crisis of conscious.  In what universe does it make sense that the scene in the basement never comes up between the two of them???????????????  "

So she will naturally follow his lead. Shes also his partner in the fight, so following his directions is paramount to victory (see ""leeeeee royyyyy jenkins!!!!!"" for what happens when some idiot does his own thing in a fight).

And while Asuna was placed in captivity in season 2, the lead female role was replaced by Kirito's sister, who is in no way helpless at all, who [SPOILER] saves his life at the end.   Finally, in season 3 (the gun-game), he teams up with a sniper-girl suffering to overcome her PTSD.

Simply put, you can't place an expectation of optimal action on the main character, and you can't keep putting yourself in their shoes. To me, it's almost evidence that you want to like Kirito more than you do. Additionally, a lot of people overestimate Kirito's power level; he's about on level with Asuna for the entire game. Notably in the Death Scythe fight, he can't handle the boss and needs to 2v1 it with Asuna. Additionally, Klein and others are around the same strength level but simply don't have Kirito's reflexes or resolve, which he's honed through being a solo player.  He mentions something something about a support network and players banding together, and they do (the Army for instance, and the blacksmith dude who spends all of his profits helping level mid-level players), and he just missed that because our protagonist plays solo and the show lightly touches on all of those aspects."
t1_csw1xe2,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"That is true Kirito and Asuna took on Death Scythe together but really Kirito's dual wielding and newfound skill was what won the fight. Klein is not on Kirito's level in terms of strength, power or even battle-healing. IIRC Kirito has maxed out most if not all of his battle stats whilst Klein has decent to high-range stats. Not much of what he has mentioned has been explained in the actual series. I can't like Kirito because he never struggles to progress, he always screams his way out of everything and has never lost a fight. He breaks out of paralysis and saves Asuna, how did that happen? He destroys a boss monster because he's pissed off that his guild was wiped? I thought this was a group game? None of this can be explained because the writer made that fatal mistake. Top 50 anime don't make these core mistakes.   Sticking together is the best bet for every character in a group-based MMO but apparently Kirito is above that. Another question is how is Asuna's stats roughly lower or the same as Kirito's when she has been with an actual guild doing far more dungeons than what Kirito seemed to be doing?"
t1_csu1ujy,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and excellently paced. This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.  There's a ton of pacing issues I found with the first half. There motivations of the characters was not really compelling, lots of exposition was given when it could have been significantly condensed, there were odd dead spots in episodes and awkward conversation I didn't care about.   Sure, if you compare it to something like bleach, DBZ, or naruto it's pretty good, but try comparing the pacing to kill la kill and it looks horrible, or the dialog and condensed information of psycho-pass and SAO just falls short."

t1_ctl8trd,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I share your view, but I would like to point out:  &gt;Multiple references to Brady's preferences of the PSI of game balls and of providing a needle for use.  Even if Tom Brady prefers his ball pressure as low as legally allowed, which he should have mentioned in his appeal, he hasn't broken any rules. He can claim that he requested 12.5 PSI, and the equipment guys gave him 11.5, which is against the rules. Frankly, this is what he should have claimed all along, instead of pretending he doesn't know anything during the ""some guys like old balls"" press conference.  "
t1_ctlr9v3,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"I suggest checking out the official patriots [rebuttal](http://wellsreportcontext.com/) to the Wells Report  &gt; One giving the other a ""heads up"" that his name came up in an interview with NFL Security.    There was  national media uproar about potentially deflated game balls.  If you were one of only a handful of locker room attendants who handled the balls, of course you would be interested if your name came up.  What kind of asshole would *not* tell his friend that his name came up in an interview with security.   &gt; Multiple references to Brady's preferences of the PSI of game balls and of providing a needle for use.  Brady knew he liked his balls at 12.5 psi.  He requested the locker room guys hand the refs a highlighted copy of the rule book so they knew what range it could be.  That requires inflating (and if necessary deflating if they've been over-inflated) the balls.  Needles are required for both inflating and deflating.  &gt;  In the context of an exchange about the pressure of game balls, one said to the other that Brady ""actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done."" Mcnally's only assigned responsibility regarding game balls was to deliver them. What is there to ""get done?""  They claim they were referencing him trying to sell his game tickets.  But they claim the ""he"" that starts that quote wasn't referring to Brady.  It's one of the sketchier parts but is far from conclusive.  &gt; One expressing anger with Brady states that ""the only thing deflating sun[day] is his passing rating.""  This was the week after the referees in a Jets game inflated the Patriots balls to 16 PSI, well over the legal limit.  Given that they were being yelled at for over-inflating the balls, discussing deflating would make sense.  &gt; One refers to himself as ""the deflator"" and jokes about ""not going to ESPN ... yet.""  This was in May 2014.  If they were deflating balls all the way back to the 2013-2014 season, then how did they end up getting surprised by 16psi balls during the Jets game in the 2014-2015 season?  They say it was a reference to losing weight.  The bit about ESPN was preceded by a discussion of getting free sneakers, which they were not allowed to do.    &gt; Multiple requests for autographed gear from Tom Brady.    I would hope that Tom Brady and every major NFL star gives out signs gear for free for the lower-level team employees.  And, importantly, the Wells Report made no attempt to show that this was at all unusual for the Patriots or for NFL teams in general.  &gt; One says to the other ""I have a big needle for you this week."" The response is ""Better be surrounded by cash and new kicks... or its a rugby sunday"". When asked about this message by investigators, Mcnally confirmed that the reference to ""rugby"" meant an over-inflated football.    Yeah, guys whose job it is to inflate the balls need needles to work the pumps.  The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes.   &gt; About a week before the AFCCG, one told the other it would be a ""big autograph day for you."" Several days later, Brady signed 2 footballs and a game-worn jersey and handed them to Mcnally in the equipment room.    Again, players sign all kinds of stuff, I don't see any reason to suggest this was some kind of quid pro quo.  Unless you hear players or employees saying that it's rare for players to sign all kinds of stuff and give away used equipment, I don't think this is any evidence of anything.  And these were the guys who prepared his game balls.  It's important to keep those guys happy.    &gt; Brady ordered his phone that had been used the past 4 months to be destroyed.  Ok, admittedly destroying the phone was a bad idea, but: A) At that point, he wasn't going to give it to them anyway, so destroying didn't do anything to cover up actions. B) If Brady's lawyer were the one selecting which messages were relevant, then I don't really see how they were expecting to get any incriminating evidence of the phone anyway.  C) I think his claim that he didn't want to set a precedent of players having to turn over private cell phones or private text conversations is legit. D) Around the time of the appeal (although a bit too little, too late) he pulled the records of his text messages and said he was willing to attempt to recover the contents from the other peoples' phones.  &gt; Prior to the start of the game, Mcnally removed the Patriots' footballs form the Officials' Locker Room without informing or receiving permission from any of the game's officials, then he went to a small bathroom and locked the door even though he had access to the facilities in the Officials' Locker Room.    The AFC championship game was unusual in the sense that it was delayed due to the late ending of the NFC championship game.  As a result the pregame timing was a little different, and the Officials Locker Room was crowded with people watching the end of the other game.    "

The franchise's response *would* try to address everything with an excuse, whether anyone were guilty or not, but most of it seems perfectly reasonable.

t1_ctltslz,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"There are two issues with Deflategate that are at odds with each other:  1. There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence (but no direct evidence) suggesting that McNally deliberately deflated the Patriots footballs, and that Tom Brady knew about it. 2. The Patriots footballs were not deflated.  These points are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Only one of those two things is true.  You detailed all the aspects of Point #1. It's an incredibly compelling story, filled with drama. There's a villain, there's a conspiracy, there's a fall from grace. It's awesome.  Point #2 is much more mundane. The Patriots balls were at 12.50 PSI before the game, they lost 1.01 PSI due to the cold weather, and that's that. It's a boring explanation.  It's science versus faith.  Point #1 has a lot of vague inferences that you can interpret however you like. You choose to interpret them to mean that footballs were deflated; I interpret them another way. Regardless of interpretation, the story doesn't have an ""I prefer footballs below 12.5"", or ""I'll deflate the footballs"", or security footage of deflation, or a confession, or any witnesses at all. There is no direct evidence. You can make your interpretations, and have faith that they're correct.  Point #2 is pure science. According to the Ideal Gas Law, the Patriots footballs should have lost between 0.98 and 1.18 PSI during the first half *if they were not deflated*. They lost 1.01 PSI. Therefore, they were not deflated.  I'm not trying to change your view, I just want to point out the difference between the groups, and make it clear which group you are in."

How was Trayvon supposed to know this guy following him wasn't going to jack him up and steal his wallet? Just because he's not black? Zimmerman was invading Trayvon's space and profiling him and following him around. I'd be really sketched out and concerned if that was happening to me.  You have no way of knowing Trayvon put his hands on Zimmerman ""because he thought he deserved a beat down."" That phrasing also postures it as if Trayvon were following Zimmerman around, which was not the case.

t1_cb3qcwp,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"Because the claim that Martin acting in self defense (as an attempt to prevent a claim that Zimmerman acted in self-defense) makes no sense when you acknowledge that the ""terrified"" Martin chose not to escape the situation when given more than enough time.  If I thought I was being chased by someone who might hurt me, I'd be behind a locked door and calling the cops in under a minute.  Zimmerman did not, at the time, think that Martin was attacking him.  He thought he found the burglar, whose reactions, including the first flight, fit the expected profile of a criminal caught red handed.  Assuming Zimmeran's story was true (we just don't know), that makes Martin the one who initiated the physical conflict that led to Zimmerman fearing for his life and shooting Martin.  From common sense and forensics point of view, there are more unknowns that work in Zimmerman's favor than Martin's.  Martin is terrified and running away, but chooses not to move to safety.  Why?  Zimmerman somehow ended up on his back with a wounded head before shooting Martin (who was directly on top of him).  How?  Even their attitudes.  Zimmerman was don't-let-him-escape angry, while Martin seemed ""do anything to survive"" scared... It would be flip-a-coin over who started it, except that Martin seems to have chosen fight over flight in those 4 minutes when Zimmerman hadn't even gotten that far."

So even if Zimmerman pushed/punched Martin, all he could do back is throw a punch. Instead, Martin got him on the ground, crouched over him, and beat his head into the concrete. That's escalating the situation. Since Martin had exactly 0 injuries, it's easy to see who did the escalating.

Zimmerman got to tell everyone that martin threw the first punch and Martin can not tell anyone his side of the story because Zimmerman shot him.

t1_cbcwihs,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,"As to point number 2, you ask me if I've ever been in a fight, yet you clearly fail to grasp that being punched repeatedly in the head can absolutely be fatal.  It happens all the time.  If I have someone on top of me, punch my head, bouncing it off the cement, with no sign of stopping....am I supposed to wait until I pass out and hope he doesnt continue?  No, absolutely not.  In that situation, as Zimmerman has claimed (and the evidence has pointed to) he was 100% well within his right to defend himself with lethal force if he felt like his life might be in danger.  And I think in that situation, given the circumstance, it should be easy to think that anyone could feel that their life could be in danger if it was an ongoing attack that showed no signs of slowing down or stopping.  Trayvon Martin is dead because Trayvon Martin threw the first punch, and then mount and continue to beat Zimmerman bloody.    If Martin simply gets in his face and starts a verbal argument, and then Zimmerman shoots, its a completely different story and Zimmerman would be jail.  Martin sealed his fate with the vicious, continuing attack.  Plain and simple.  I don't know how someone with an honest bone in their body could argue otherwise.

t3_1fqssq,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"This post will focus on software patents since that is what I am most familiar with.  I think that the patent system should serve two purposes: rewarding effort, and providing incentives for innovation, and that it currently does that. Some of the problems people often bring up in the current system are:  Patents are granted for things that are too easy to create: I think that the expiration date for a patent should be set by the examiner and should be dependent on the investment that went into developing the technology. Drug patents that require billions of dollars of research can continue to have long terms. Software patents that require half a year of research by a few people will have shorter terms. This is not a major overhaul of the system, and supports the goal of providing incentives for innovation by forcing companies to continue to innovate if they want to have exclusive access to technology (and all the financial benefits that gives).  Patents are granted for things that have already been invented: These patents should not be granted. This is not a change to the current system.  Patent trolls are a thing: If the patents being used to 'troll' are legitimate, I think this is not a problem, due to the goal of rewarding effort. I think that a person who is a skilled inventor but unskilled at manufacturing, distribution, marketing, or all the other things necessary to make money from an invention should still be rewarded for his invention, by selling the right to use his invention to other companies. Or, he should be able to outsource the selling part to people who are good at that, while he continues doing what he is good at, which is inventing.  Patents are granted on math: Allowing patents on math helps provide both stated goals of the patents system. If someone discovers or create a new algorithm or formula, they should be rewarded for it, even though it is ""Just"" math.  To the people who think that all patents should be abolished, or that all patents within a certain industry should be abolished: I think that would result in a return to the days of trade secrets, which I would consider to be a very bad thing, and result in more incentives to protect your secrets than incentives to innovate.  To change my view you must either show that your proposed change to the patent system will further the goals I’ve provided for the patent system, or you must change my view on what the goals of the patent system should be."

t3_1qm5d4,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,"I'll try and justify it with these reasons (which also stop many of the arguments I usually hear against it)  * The soundtrack was just amazing, the slow paces for moving scenes and the impending crescendo for when Weyland Yutani arrives was some of the best I've ever heard (Eg, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ckg2RaCpTI#t=158))  * The death of Newt and Hicks... boy oh boy is this a tough one to defend. Although it makes Aliens seem pointless, an earlier draft of the script shed some good light on it: Newt was going to be a host to an alien, and would have died in either agony of her chest exploding or her surroundings exploding - instead her last memories and feelings were safety and security in the Sulaco, and she would've died in peace. The same can be said for Hicks. From a practical standpoint, it also helped move the script along - if they had both survived, how many other ways could a potential sequel 'end' without Ripley saving Newt? It also fits the Alien franchise rather well - the Xenomorphs being without conscience or remorse, taking away everything.   * It was the most original of the Alien movies. Out of the 4 sequels, how many ended with Ripley blasting the last Alien out of a spaceship? The first, second, and fourth (If you'd call that a xeno) Rather than copy the first two films, it went down a different direction with a dark prison-y environment. A bald Ripley certainly made for a different change (Her hair is almost a metaphor, long for innocence in Alien, short for anxiety and confidence in Aliens and no more for Alien^3 , showing she had lost it all and accepted it), this one brought closure for Ripley.   * She was finishing off the Xeno's by killing herself and spiting the company that made her lose everything trying to get it, the most sensible and plausible ending in a universe like this  * The cast was great. From everyday truckers to cocky marines, a British cast of prisoners was a great idea for the next installment. ~~Tywin Lanister~~ Charles Dance made an excellent addition to cast as well as Charles Dutton, along with other heavyweights like Pete Postlethwaite in the mix. The funeral scene was the most poignant moment in the whole series IMO.  * The sets and backgrounds looked great, despite the actual alien. Yes I will admit the Alien looked very CGI (although it was a puppet added over the film), the brooding planet and almost goth-like prison halls were a nice theme and very fitting for a murky alien.  * The alien itself made for a smart change too. From a general soldier to a Queen, the 'runner' or dog/ox-alien was an interesting take on it. (And would also become cannon regarding aliens taking on their hosts form for the expanded universe)  * One of the most important things I noted about it was the genuine reactions people have to it. When watching Alien people would exclaim ""Man I'd *shit* my pants in that situation"" or in Aliens they would cry ""WHOO GAME OVER MAN BREAK OUT THE BIG GUNS"" but would react exactly as intended to Alien^3 like they were in the movie.   &gt; ""I'm so upset Newt and Hicks died!!""   &gt; ""Why did Clemens die so early, he was the only good guy!""  &gt; ""Wait these tunnels are confusing me""  &gt; ""Is that another Bishop droid or the real dude?""  * As for the plothole about the eggs on the Sulaco, I think the Queen in extenuating circumstances would lay a few eggs as an emergency safeguard for the population. One would certainly be a Queen with a few others to guard it. These eggs did not have time to mature like the ones in the Queen Sack (ick) So after a while in the landing gear on the dropship, these eggs may be wired to actively search nearby hosts due to the urgency. *OR* they may have been moved by an automated system on the Sulaco to move organic material, even the possibility the company intended this from long distance.  * Although the first two movies are fantastic, they could be a little bit limited at times - if you step back to look at it, the ending of Aliens with Ripley fighting off a Queen with a free tail and arms should be impossible, but was overlooked cause she was being a hero. In this movie she was a lot more human.  * Not necessarily horror or action, I think this is almost borderline Sci-Fi Drama  All in all I thought it was a worthy sequel to the first two and concluded the series nicely. Alien Resurrection was a bit meh, no where near the same par."
t1_cde6meq,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; True I just don't think she had much wiggle room, most tails on animals are fairly accurate and within their control.  She has a bit of wiggle room in there, nothing crazy. But the queen is facing Ripley and trying to maneuver its tail from the back to the front from the side, which is not something many tailed creatures try to do.  &gt; I think the AvP series are no longer cannon since Prometheus came out  Howso? The Weyland in Prometheus is Peter Weyland, as as far as I can tell it takes place far after AvP. Charles Weyland could be his father or grandfather.  Edit: It could still no longer be cannon, but seeing as how AvP came out well after Alien3, it seemed like they were making a clear connection. Fun fact: Lance Henrikson is one of only two actors to be killed by a Predator, Xenomorph, and Terminator. The other is Bill Paxton.  &gt; But, this 'droid' was sent just to con Ripley - what's the point of screaming once she started to jump?

The tension of a female prisoner on a world of celibate men is also great.  However, the following things are really annoying:  - In the first movie, there was one alien. In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.  - No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole ""don't shoot them, they bleed acid"" and ""you need a flamethrower"" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.  - The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.  - The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God.

t1_c9d5s0t,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"Depression as a mood and depression as a mood disorder are two different things. Many people experience periods of transient depression. This is not a disorder, but it still can be quite severe and result in self-harm or suicide. Depression as a mood disorder is persistent, and in many cases lifelong, feelings of being ""down"", inadequate, worthless, suicidal, and just generally dissatisfied with life.   &gt;I've seen people who claimed to have depression one day and the next seem totally fine.  These may be people who are experiencing transient periods of depression, these may be liars, or they may be people covering up their depression. Speaking for myself as someone who has an anxiety disorder that causes persistent depression, I was known to be quite a boisterous, friendly and upbeat person in college. Many times I was the life of a party and I had a very large group of friends among whom I was known for being excitable and happy. Then I would go to my dorm room and cry or cut myself. Neither of those things was fake either. My friends genuinely made me happy, and why would I want to bring out my depression into a situation in which I was happy? Why would I want to deliberately bring myself and others down? On top of this, I would occasionally experience manic episodes. Mania is the other pole from which bipolar disorder gets its name. Whereas depression is characterized by a lack of energy and feelings of apathy or hopelessness, mania is characterized by an overwhelming intensity of energy that can result in anxiousness and panic, often resulting in that hair-trigger anger that people imagine when they think of BPD, or if you're lucky and spending time with people you like that mania can result in a high-energy euphoria that is actually one of the best feelings I have ever experienced. One of the things that bummed me out the most when I went on medication was knowing that these euphoric episodes would go away.  Anyways, hope that helped some."

t1_cky44de,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"The title of your post made me think that you wanted convincing that mentally ill or depressed people killing themselves counts as suicide and shouldn't deserve pity. However, I'll add in a point of view that shows that others are responsible or at least complicit in aiding the death of Kurt Cobain.  Depression or drug use:  If an old person is at the top of a set of stairs walking down and her leg or hip breaks due to calcium deficiency. Because of this, she falls down the stairs and dies from the injuries. One would not say that the old person committed suicide. Blaming the death on the fall also not precise. It was the injury that should be blamed much as if another person pushed her down the stairs would be blamed.  Now, instead of an old person its a person with depression. They're at the top of the stairs looking down and their mind breaks too much at that moment and they toss themselves forward. The injuries from the fall leads to his death. Do you blame the person, the fall or the mental injury?  It's the above reasons that insurance companies pay out for suicide so long as the policy is two years or older. We assume that taking out a policy just prior to suicide makes the act a conscious thought with hopes that the death leads to a cash reward to others. However, suicide as a result of mental illness is not considered a rational choice and death from that is considered as much an accident as falling down the stairs due to a physical injury.   Considering the above, you could say that killing one's self due to depression is not suicide but death due to illness. As such, given the evidence with Kurt Cobain, he did not commit suicide.  Enabling:  If a person is depressed and taking illicit drugs and alcohol that exacerbates the problem, it can be deadly. Now, what about the people that know about that person's issues and callously ignores them and even offers to provide substances or enables the destructive behavior? I would argue that falls under reckless endangerment, and given the mental illness factor could be criminal in nature.   While Courtney loved Kurt (actually, I don't know, but let's just assume so), her lifestyle continued to pull Kurt further and further down till his mind snapped to the point that he killed himself. She was the one that provided the push, and if she was not mentally ill herself can be responsible for the death of Kurt.  Conspiracy:  Not touching that path. "

Initially, it seemed as though Brown may well have been fleeing from the scene and was shot without posing a threat, but as new information has been released that seems less and less to have been the case.  Part of me thinks the outrage is largely due to the fact that people have associated Mike Brown with a greater (and admittedly perfectly legitimate) problem, namely that of police targeting of black youth.  Now that he's so strongly associated with that problem, it seems like people don't want to admit that perhaps Brown did at least reasonably seem to pose a threat because it would feel like they're betraying a cause they care a lot about, even if to admit that would be the more reasonable position to take.

The officer pursued the two boys as they ran from his car, which I think is a perfectly reasonable thing for a police officer to do, and shot Brown at some point after he'd turned around.  What Brown was actually doing after he turned around is under dispute, but the fact that there's a reasonable chance Brown was behaving in a way that would have appeared life-threatening to Wilson is, I think, sufficient legal justification for the action Wilson took.

Actually though I see something here that might change my view.  What do you think the proper protocol was?  How should Wilson have handled the situation?

It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.  This cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on.

If people can be trained and briefed on how to take down unarmed (or melee equipped) people with no concept of injury or harm in a blind rage without any collateral damage to the subject, he damn well could have handled it better.  I'm not saying the officer had to react THAT severely, but he had full ability to get to non-lethal before jumping up to shooting him 12 times.

Obviously, cops are the same because criminals and autists function on the same level and officers always have backup ready."" What you propose is laughable because you seem to value life for no apparent reason. Situation come up where it is more convenient to kill someone than to risk getting hurt or killed. If you can't accept that then maybe you should lead by example and try to physically restrain a criminal that is intent on killing you."
t1_cmdfadm,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Admittedly the facism thing was just bullshit. But here are some points we can move along on.   1)Cops are trained to subdue people. This is true, but they are also trained to be physically fit, courteous/professional, and competent in the law. However, most cops rarely get more than 6 months of training. Taking into account that 6 months of doing anything puts the average person at a skill level of just above novice, we have to know what their abilities are. Cops will not be able to stop an assailant without causing serious injury or death. Just like anyone else, they are entitled to kill if an assailant presents them with the intent to harm/kill them. Police do not magically have the ability to subdue criminals.  2)Killing someone is rarely the best option. But we hardly choose our circumstances, especially when our assailants force those circumstances on us. We have to recognize that police officers being attacked can not change circumstances simply because they have been trained. They are just like any other average person. And so they should be given the right to defend themselves just like any other average person.  3)If cops should/ought to be the type of people to be able to prevail over these kinds of circumstances then we need to either extend the rights of the average citizen as to make the service of police obsolete or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers. I think that in order to satisfy your standard of what an officer should be able to do, we need to train them to be on par with special military forces. The problem with that is that we give the government a paramilitary force in small towns.  Imagine if you will: Police are trained to a standard such that they can physically subdue someone 100lbs heavier than them. Do we really want every police officer in our town to have that much power? Do we want government giving orders to such people? Police forces are already corrupt but now they have the physical power to act with impunity. I guess this is where my facism thing ties in.  In short, we either need to give more rights to citizens so that police are obsolete and we can avoid police brutality or we must train police to be on par with the military and risk giving government and police too much power.  "
t1_cmdtn63,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I think we have more common ground than we thought. Essentially, yes, cops are town guards with itchy trigger fingers. I don't think we'll ever see them trained to any standard of competence. We have to stop worrying about cops and start talking about giving citizens the rights to defend themselves. At least when citizens defend themselves they are held liable to the full extent of the law. In this way, we can create a culture where it is understood that assaulting someone has deep consequences but that defending your life also has some restrictions."
t1_cmeg54f,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; we need to train them to be on par with special military forces.  Funny thing that, part of being spec ops is being *part of the community*.

t1_cmdupvw,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"In the encounter between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, things were not at trial, which is where this standard of innocence until proven guilty applies. Obviously police cannot arbitrarily search people and places without a warrant or proper suspicion, which is part of our system of due process.  However, if an individual is innocent and happens to match the profile of a suspect that just fleed the scene of a crime nearby, running away or tussling with the cop is not the appropriate response. There is a legal process to handle this. If someone just robbed a bank—or a convenience store—for example, the police should not just give up because the suspect isn't going to play nice and submit to questioning or arrest. If this happened, criminals would always just run away, and the police would be powerless because to do anything more would be to ""escalate.""  Michael Brown did not want to go to jail for what he had just done, I would imagine. In all likelihood, if he had submitted to arrest, he would have been in jail for a few hours—or a few days max until he was bailed out—and then given a fine, community service, and probation (of course he may have feared he'd spend the next six months in jail); his crime was not the most serious. Unfortunately, if the testimony and gunshot evidence is indeed all accurate, he doubled down on the stupid and decided to fight back against the police officer."
t1_cml4gcq,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"It is under the law, so yeah it kind of matters to a jury. Brown was charging him according to several witnesses.

t1_cmlh163,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"Walking away? He ran from the car. He was being confronted because he hit a cop. The cop then pursued him. He kept his distance and didn't fire. Then brown, probably because Wilson was following him, charged at Wilson. Only then did Wilson shoot the man. "
t1_cmfx2yt,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"From reading all the witness testimonies that would open in my browser and other evidence there seemed to be a general agreement that:  * There was a scuffle in the car and Brown was shot * Michael Brown got free and ran a significant distance away (50 yards) * Darren Wilson shot at Brown as he was running away, but didn't hit him (one bullet might have grazed him) * Brown turned around, put his hands up and started walking back, lowering his head * Wilson continued to shoot at Brown and finally killed him with a shot to the head  The whole encounter apparently lasted roughly a minute.  It seems unlikely to me that Wilson made up much of the distance during that time. He probably got out of the car and started shooting from where he was. I doubt he can shoot and run at the same time. If he was running after Brown he would have to holster his gun or run with his gun drawn, both of which would make him run more slowly than Brown who had a head start and probably in fear for his life.  I believe the testimony that Wilson was shooting at Brown while he was running away, because it's the most reasonable explanation for why Brown turned around and put his hands up.  So from what I can piece together, Wilson was probably 30-40 yards away from Brown and Brown with his hands up, walking a few paces forward. If these are the facts then Wilson, a trained police officer, was clearly not in imminent danger. "

It seems from the canon that going up a level on being a super saiyan initially leads to some of the negative saiyan traits coming out in the person. Perhaps Goku feels that it is the positive virtues such as honor, mercy, etc. which allow a saiyan to overcome the tendency to give into the rage of a super saiyan transformation."

So I'm gonna lay out the benefits and ignore the costs (related to care and such) that I'm sure you are aware of them with your cat experiences.  1) Your *Boo-Bear*  Yeah, I'm talking about your boyfriend, I'm not sure what you call each other, so I'm gonna roll with that.  Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.  2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like ""woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!""  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?  2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!  3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!

t1_ctilqsl,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"For this discussion, we have to carefully examine canon. Broly isn't part of it, and Baby/DBZ GT is out.  What we *do* have is a huge theme and one single direct line, given by Goku: *The greater the opponent, the more I rise up.* (or something to that effect). In other words, he matches new challenges.   If you take a look at the Saiyans, they were all weaker than Frieza's main henchmen until Goku and Vegeta started 'rising up to meet the challenge' on a one-on-one basis against each other and against enemies like Pui Pui, Dodoria, Zarbon, and then the Ginyu Force. Every single one of these fights ended in severe injury and near death, but then an opportunity for Zenkai followed.  There's a small window of opportunity in a race that gets stronger in response to challenges. If the enemy is too weak, then there's no advancement; if the enemy is too strong, the Saiyan just dies.  Thus, Goku and Vegeta (and their children) are not exceptions to the rule at all, but rather extremely lucky to progressively face tougher foes on a step by step one-on-one basis.  You can see this window of opportunity *being missed* when Vegeta powers up after the Ginyu Force fight and is able to match first-form Frieza. Frieza transforms and gets stronger, and Vegeta simply loses. He survives with Dende's healing, and would be able to match second and third form Frieza for sure - but he fails again! Because Frieza's final form is just too strong. This is how most Saiyans would meet their end. He just happens to be revived by the Dragonballs later.  So the Saiyan race would not have simply all continued to get stronger to the point of threatening the universe. A great many of them would have gotten in fights over their heads and died; more would have picked on weaker races and failed to advance. Only a very small number of procedurally lucky fighters advance to levels like Goku and Vegeta.  In fact, Goku and Vegeta's luck ran out. They both died at various points. It's only the Dragonballs that are truly responsible for continuing their step-by-step slightly-stronger-enemy faceoffs. What we witness in DBZ is a race's tragic cultural flaw getting them into fights over their capabilities until they all get killed. Fighting people stronger than you is a Saiyan's best opportunity for advancement *and* greatest risk. Eventually, your luck runs out, and Saiyans were culturally bred to just be okay with that fact.  Frieza couldn't count on luck, though. He saw their Zenkai enemy-matching ability and destroyed them to completely prevent it from getting out of control. "

I could see him having an actual following if he had a deeper voice, or had a more Hitler style of giving sermons.  Eli doesn't really serve any purpose after Daniel bought the land.  H.W.  H.W. is pretty much just Daniel's cute face, which at least Daniel admits, but he's really not relevant to the plot in the least and doesn't even need to exist.  Henry.  What the fuck was the point of that?  If there's any characters who I missed, well, they weren't memorable then.  * Plot/Narrative:  There doesn't seem to be one.  What the fuck was that ending?  * Storytelling:  I don't think the people who made this movie know what story telling actually is, the entire film just seems disjointed and makes no sense.    * Music:  The music didn't really add to the movie in most cases, it just was kind of in the way.  So, there's my reasons for not liking the movie.  So many people give it such high praise, and I don't even understand why.  I checked the Wikipedia article for it and the worst reviews it got basically said ""meh.""  I'm not even meh about this movie, I downright don't like it."

I really liked it, but one of the reasons I did was because my ancestors homesteaded in Texas, and were involved in the ""all bidness"" in the 20th Century. "
t1_ccikowu,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"There Will Be Blood is a character study. And like in all character studies the plot is only really relevant in so far as it develops the character. So saying there isn't much of a plot isn't really a critique. There doesn't necessarily need to be one.   As far as Plainview's character. I don't see any sort of sudden shift after H.W. loss of hearing. From the very start Plainview is a ruthless business man to the point of being a sociopath. When Plainview takes H.W. initially it isn't because he cares for the child, but because he sees a way to take advantage of him to further his business. Plainview consistently shows throughout the movies that he will go to any length to make more money. And that is the purpose that Henry serves. You notice that Plainview lets Henry hang around up until the point where he threatens the business, then Plainview snaps and murders this man that we thought he had formed a loose bond with.   As for Eli, he is not supposed to be a likeable character. I am surprised that you don't think his speeches were any good as they are some of the most striking and forceful in recent memory. And despite the high pitched voice he is a very strong character and nearly as ruthless as Plainview. Being soft spoken doesn't prevent people from rising to power especially in a religion like Christianity that praises meekness. You will also notice that his parish seems to be well cowed with no particularly strong individuals.   I am also quite shocked you didn't like the music. I don't think there is any way to change your view on this as it is going to come down to a matter of taste. However, myself and most other people that saw it found it was widely considered one of the best soundtracks of the year. It would have been a strong contender for the Oscar for best score, but it used non-original material."
t1_ccip0by,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,It is not necessary to have a complex character for a character study in feature film. The character only needs to be interesting. I think that Plainview is plenty interesting. There was some ambiguity in his character that keeps you intrigued. There is obviously something to his relationship with H.W. that goes beyond simple exploitation. Saving him from the oil well and the way he cradle him afterwards shows that there is some sort feelings there. Also how he greets H.W. on his return from the school again shows that something has developed between them. Also his interactions with Henry show that he wanted some sort of human relationship otherwise he would of just sent him away after their first meeting.  I didn't have any problem with the structure of the movie or the leaps in time. This is the first I've heard of anybody having issue with that as well. I don't know what else to say about that.  I don't think broader context was really necessary for the film and in fact think that the intense focus on Plainview was one of its strengths. I think broadening the focus would have meant that the film would have lost its tension.  I don't see Plainview killing Eli as puzzling. In fact I think it is really the only ending that would have made sense. What happens to somebody that is driven by success to sociopathic ends after they win that success? They turn on themselves and anybody around them. This is why it also showed Plainview pushing H.W. out of his life for good.
t1_ccj23jt,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt;I disagree, why do you think Plainview doesn't have a reason to be the way he is? I don't think every character trait needs an explanation for something to be considered good writing. I don't think his motivations behind the things he does are necessary, as he is a believable character. I buy that a person like Plainview might have existed. My armchair psychology diagnoses would be borderline personality disorder.  When you have behavior as extreme as Plainview's tends to be, you need *something* to tell you why. Otherwise it just seems arbitrary. I don't think we need his whole life story but there is almost nothing in the film that gives you any clue as to why Plainview is the way he is.  &gt;You've made me think about the scene where he tells Henry about his competitive drive a little more. And something has struck me about it, he starts out by asking Henry if he has a competitive side to him (and remember he was under the impression that Henry was his brother). This signals to me that Daniel knows something is wrong with him - and suspects a mental illness might run in the family. Like I said before, we don't get much but bits and pieces about Daniel's past, but it's clear he didn't care much for his home. Perhaps his father suffered similarly?  Maybe, but I think that's a lot to draw from one question. He could just as easily been sizing his ""brother"" up to see if he would be a threat.  &gt;We're you watching a different movie than me? Plainview comes across (to me) as a tortured and lonely person who treats the world with disdain (""I hate people""). He can stop thinking about other people's success and it drives him crazy. He can't even take his kid to a nice meal without A) Drinking and B) Hassling the competitors who show up. I don't view him as the villain - after all he does provide the town with the wealth and prosperity he promised. He just also used up everything else so no one else could compete with him. He's not a good person. But I don't see anything he does as particularly malicious until he beats Eli to death.  Lonely I'll buy but he comes off more as a sociopath who puts his own needs and wants ahead of everything and everyone else. He does provide for people but it seems like more of a business transaction, buying goodwill so he can continue drilling, rather than genuine altruism. He's willing to try and cheat Eli's family out of their property, he uses HW, I'm pretty sure that qualifies as malicious.  "

All this to say,  I understand why they avoided that card and I still believe the outcome of this case if Trayvon had been white.  You may have not changed my view but for what it's worth, have an upvote."
t1_cb44gly,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt; I understand why they avoided that card  I think the main reason they avoided that card is because they knew Zimmerman was not a racist.  &gt; I still believe the outcome of this case if Trayvon had been white. [would have been different]?  It *is* hard to tell, sure.  We'll never know.  But in white+white cases, where a competent defence is presented regarding a self-defence claim of not guilty, you just don't see guilty.   Nothing about the event, about Martin's criminal history, or about the forensics suggests that Martin did not initiate an *apparently* violent attack against Zimmerman.  We know that:  1. Both parties were on edge  2. Martin had an opportunity to leave the scene, but did not (this piece may not have been related, but can be meaningful in aggregate)  3. Martin had Zimmerman pinned to the ground with Zimmerman having a head wound at the time of the shooting.  Of course, 3 is the big one unless someone has a *strong* argument that Zimmerman escalated physical assault.  An out-of-shape guy was in a position he probably could not escape from, having received the first of (what could have been many, or could not have been any more) wounds that would have a good chance of permanently injuring or killing him.  That's such an overwhelming amount of reasonable doubt that only a terrible defence couldn't get one person on a jury.  The police didn't seem to *want* to arrest, the DA didn't seem to *want* to prosecute.  There's a good reason.  They had to know the odds were slim and that they could not prosecute later if new evidence came out.  Nothing is worse than having your hand forced when you know that's the end of the game.  I think you're focusing a lot on the unarmed 17 year old... a jury would be focused on the unarmed 17 year old on TOP of an out-of-shape old guy slamming his head in the ground... and then the judge would speak to them and tell them repeatedly about ""reasonable doubt"".  He would repeat ""reasonable doubt"" until the first reasonable doubt led people to go ""oh, shit...that's reasonable doubt""  A key part of your belief is that there were assumptions made of him being dangerous.  How could anyone portray anyone else on top of a guy slamming his head into the ground as NOT dangerous?  Further, while he did not have a criminal record, he would be extremely easy to paint as a criminal, from his violent/angry photographs to the *reasons* of his suspension from high school.    Then, look at stuff like this [picture](http://axiomamnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/martin-zimmerman-case-trayvons-body-crime-scene.png).  The jury did.  The jury also (presumably) heard that Martin bragged about being a repeat violent offender so much that his own mother thought he was arrested when he was 5-hours late from 7/11.  If you've got testimony that supports ""I beat the shit out of people who look at me wrong"" and suddenly that person is shot while on to of a wounded man with no violent history, and there are no good witnesses... if the story matches the forensics, and there's no compelling evidence, the guy walks."
t1_cb3hcuv,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; The combination of innocent until proven guilty + reasonable doubt creates a pretty high bar.  It's supposed to.

t1_cb3han6,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"With or without media? I think the defining factor of the Not Guilty verdict was the magical by-the-book reaction to a case being highly covered.  When the cameras are watching, you don't bend rules... and the rules actually favor the defendant heavily. (better 10 guilty free than 1 innocent jailed).    If Martin was white, the media probably wouldn't have been around (hillarious, because there's so much evidence and so many arguments that this was NOT a race-related crime.. unless you say that Martin's initiation was due to his racism against Zimmerman the ""creepy-ass cracker"" (his words).  &gt; To be honest I really believe the real issue to this case is the fact that a dead teen was unable to give his side of the story.   Of course it is... but Zimmerman's story fit the evidence... which suggested Zimmerman was on the ground on his back, firing at point blank range at Martin above him.  That alone reeks of reasonable doubt.  No media cameras and a shitty lawyer? Might not have won a case, but that would be a failure of Justice.  &gt;  Had Trayvon been white we would have been more focused n fact that an unarmed teen was killed by an armed adult.  An armed adult who he had tackled, and who had just hit his head on concrete from the conflict.  It would take a spectacular prosecutor, a lazy judge, or a terrible defendant, to lose this case.

The girlfriend then claims that here is where Zimmerman attacked while Zimmerman claims that Treyvon doubled back and went chasing after Zimmerman.  Now, the body was found a good 100 ft or so away from Treyvon's mom's fiancee's house in the direction of Zimmerman's car.  This means that if Treyvon had reached his mom's fiancee's house, he wouldve had to double back and chase after Zimmerman to instigate the fight at the location where the body was found.  The location of the body is consistent with Zimmerman's story and is a very likely indicator that Treyvon started the attack.  This fact alone can acquit Zimmerman by simply claiming self defense."

I and many others enjoy the books when the action wasn't heavy. Book 5 was action light- they were mostly ignoring Voldemort and focusing on Hogwarts dramas, and so that was my favorite. But book 3 was nothing exception in its lack of combat in the main book.   Book 2 was actually slower for me. The basilisk petrified random people but Harry was never in any real danger from it, being a main character. He didn't fight it."
t1_cbsfdsh,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"1.  The worst thing that Voldemort could do to harry is kill him.  A dementor can eat his soul.  So not only is he a mindless automaton until his body gives out, but he can't come back as a ghost, and he can't ""go on"" and be with his parents.  Dementors are one of the scariest enemies, not just in HP, but in all of fiction.  *Machin Shin* from the Wheel of Time is about the only thing scarier.  2.  Prisoner of Azkaban sets up Sirius's storyline, and finally gives Harry a family - not that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley weren't fantastic surrogate parents, but in the books, a godfather/godkid relationship is portrayed to be 99% as important as that between biological parents and their kids.  3.  Buckbeak is a badass.  4.  Excellent quidditch action."
t1_cbsfzmb,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"The third book is absent of danger? What about the Dementors that Harry regularly encounters, nearly dying most of the time? While Sirius Black ends up being an ally, for the first part of the book, there definitely was a very real fear of the idea of Sirius Black.   PoA has a lot of the same elements (such as how developed the world is and the humour, etc.) as the first two books, but is a lot darker in a sense. It builds up an inevitably direct clash between good and evil. You mention that the best books are ones like the Chamber of Secrets, but Voldemort didn't even really come into play until the end; the characters were more worried about the Basilisk (though they didn't know it was, in fact, a Basilisk). In PoA, there is supposed to be someone directly out to get Harry, which doesn't go for the first two. In my opinion, that's more of a danger.  Regarding angst: books like The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are way, way more angsty. In fact, off the top of my head, all that I can really think about that qualifies as angst in PoA is when Harry contemplates going after Sirius Black (which isn't even necessarily teenage angst, seeing as it could happen to anyone), and Ron and Hermione's issues with each other. As a matter of fact, I think that one of the better parts of PoA is that develops characters in a much better way than the first two books, while not laying it on too much. The characters grow way more in this book than the first two, and there are way more moral issues and such.  And yet, even though there's character development and such, one thing I really like about PoA is that it still retains similar flavour and charm from the first two books. However, it's the only year where disasters and other things don't ruin the year for the students, even though dark events are still unfolding. Things like the Boggart lesson and the Quidditch final are enjoyable because nothing like that really happens in other books. In the first book, everything was new and shiny; in the second, there were people being attacked; in the fourth book, there was the Triwizard Tournament; in the fifth, there was Umbridge; in the sixth, the anti-Voldemort movement was started, and the the last book was barely at Hogwarts. PoA mixes the danger of the second with the world-building of the first in a good way.   It's also a really good transition and set-up for the Voldemort-filled part of the series, and the ending isn't a perfect Hollywood ending like the first two. There are doubts and the real servant of Voldemort is on the loose at the end. It's less sweet. It's nice to have Harry save the day, win a million points for Gryffindor with his antics, and have his friends all cheer for him, but it's far more interesting to have an ending that leaves you with questions and doubts for the next book. Voldemort doesn't hurt Harry at the end, but his servant is off to resurrect him.   Also, I don't know why you're merely dismissing the backstory and time travel aspects. The backstory was really interesting. The time travel was plain cool. It was icing on the cake, but at least it can help in avoiding last place.   Finally, the third book is, in my opinion, one of the best to re-read. For more intense books like the last one, a lot of the intensity/drama/action/suspense is lost when you re-read it. The PoA is a good mix of mystery and other stuff, so it's better for re-reading.   **TL;DR, PoA has more danger, better character development and world-building, a better ending and re-read value, and lots of other cool factors, including time travel.**"
t1_cbt1zp5,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Reading all of these answers has reminded me of all the legitimately awesome stuff in this book, and I thank every one of you, but I'll respond to this one to bring up my one remaining caveat.  It seems that the reason PoA is great is because it fleshes out the HP world a lot more drastically than the first two did, and brings out a lot of side stories that make the HP world so interesting. One example I just remembered is the Ministry being a much more real presence, which brought a maturity to a world that was mostly run by a just-kids mentality for two books. However, even though the distractions from Voldemort were much-needed and never boring, it feels like PoA was artificially set up as such. The later books (i.e. the much longer ones) had what I feel is a better balance of non-Voldy plot development and main storyline events. But in PoA, it feels like Rowling decided to dedicate an entire book to just fleshing out the world. It was obviously successful, but I think it stands out as something like a very interesting intermission for the series instead of a legitimate entry in the saga of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived."

t3_2b3p94,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"First of all, I'd like to say that I myself am an 18 year old male, and I do suffer from acne. Recently, it's been getting better, but before it wasn't looking so good.  So my belief is that if you've got a bunch of acne and/or scars on your face, no one will find you attractive. I believe that looks aren't everything, but I think they're a big chunk of how you are seen. With horrible looks due to having acne, there's no way that life can be great for you until you find some way to clear it all.  I am aware that 80-90% of the population has to deal with acne, but of all those people, probably 90% of them have like a pimple a year or something. I'm not talking about those people being unattractive. I'm talking about the other 10% or whatever that have it REALLY bad.  Although I think the occasional couple of pimples is ok, I don't think I could see myself dating someone with a face full of pimples. Likewise, I don't see anyone that would want to be with me because of the acne on my face.  Would someone change my view and prove to me that you can still be seen as attractive even with acne? I would really like to change my mindset right now.... and I promise to read through anything and everything posted here. Thank you! "

t1_cqdsvuv,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; That said, he still has at least two friends out there, and he knows an illegal but valuable trade, so it's reasonable to assume he scraped his life together sort of.  Or he's just going to end up dead or in jail .. He still hasn't regained control of his life in any meaningful way. He didn't have much if anything to do with earning back his physical freedom. In any event I don't think the scene was written / shot in a way that acknowledges the serious lack of closure for Jesse, but just tries to leave us on a 'high note'.   &gt; But ultimately, I don't think it was about redemption, it was about revenge, and again, about being a provider for the man Walter pretty clearly saw as surrogate family, especially after the rest of his family rejected him.  Revenge that was not hollow, as it should have been, but targeted at characters who were clearly and unquestionably antagonistic. Walter's final revenge was deliberately constructed so that we'd be completely on his side for the first time since many seasons prior. That was a cop-out on the part of the writers. "
t1_cqdsobc,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt; Jessie...no money, friends, or family left so it's actually quite depressing if you think about it. I don't believe the scene of his euphoric 'escape' is meant to be ironic in that sense, but instead another attempt to please fans.   read interviews from Gilligan and co post Breaking Bad. They pretty much agree with you. However, it's the most realistic ""nice ending"" he could get. Sure his life sucks but 1. he's free that means he's no longer a meth slave!!! and 2. he showed real agency rejecting Walter White's demands for perhaps the first time.   &gt; but for the love of cooking meth   that's not what i took away from that speech. ""i did it for me"" is admitting he did it for himself, for the power, money, status, etc. He's confessing his sins and achieving a brief true reconcilliation.    &gt; It turned Walter from an evil criminal back into an avenging hero  to be fair remember why Walter goes back. He doesn't go back to save Jessie, he goes back because he sees baby blue and thinks Jessie is working with the nazis. He has a change of heart only after he sees Jessie. Before he's going out in a blaze of glory motivated by his supervillian thoughts.   Anyways Ozymandius king of kings look upon my works ye mighty and despair   was the ""real"" ending of Walter White supervillian. The last episodes see Walter as a broken man who sort of turned a corner.    that being said: it's clear God-showrunner granted him a ""perfect"" final couple of days and it's not clear how it makes sense that for instnace he gets into skylar's house without being detected. he gets more redemption than he deserves but the way i make sense of it is to think of it as the epilogue with ozymandius being the finale and it functions the same way the end and epilogue of say ""crime and punishment"" does.  "
t1_cqdtvt5,1.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,"Lame compared to what?  What is a finale that you found highly satisfying?  There are a couple reasons why these never live up to expectations.  1) Once a show gets big, showrunners and the network are in a tug of war over how long it should continue.  Showrunners tend to want to end the show more quickly and efficiently, whereas the network wants to drag things out (because more episodes creates more money).  Breaking Bad is a good example of this.  You have the main antagonist (Gus) killed off in season 4, but there is still more airtime to fill, so the show has to build up a whole new (less intense and shorter) story with the White Power guys.  No finale in which Walt confronts the White Power guys could have been as powerful as the end of Gus.  Related to this is the Chekov's gun problem.  If you hang a gun on the wall in Act 1, someone has to fire it by Act 3.  As shows get dragged on in unnatural ways, especially shows with commercial breaks, you need to write in lots of cliffhangers, which often involve introducing new dimensions to the story (see: Lost).  This can easily get away for you and you end up leaving a bunch of loose threads or create continuity errors (see: Lost).  Breaking Bad ties up pretty much every plot and prop point though (i.e., the ricin).     2) Classically, narratives have a certain structure: rising action, climax, falling action, denouement (reflection).  In serial TV, the big problem is that everyone wants the finale to be a huge, blockbuster episode.  But, it isn't supposed to be.  You are supposed to have the huge climax sometime before the last hour of a 40+ hour story.  Really, the last episode should be pretty calm and character-driven (think everything in Lord of The Rings after they drop the ring in the mountain).      Breaking Bad actually dealt with falling action and denouement better than most shows.  You have the showdown in Ozymandias with Hank and, then a few episodes of Walt reflecting in New Hampshire.  But because the finale needs to have some sort of major climactic event, the show needed to build in the whole White Power showdown.  Basically, it is a very tough needle to thread, and Breaking Bad probably did it better than most.  Sopranos didn't even try.  "
t1_cqdvgx3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt;Concerning Walter's ""I did it for me"" speech ... Are we meant to understand that, at the end of the day, Walter did what he did not necessarily for money or power but for the love of cooking meth / being a chemist? I kinda feel like they pulled that one out of their asses to - again - leave us feeling more sympathy for the character than we should all things considered.  Really?  This was established way back in the first season when he chooses to be a meth cook instead of accepting the Elliot's money, and is further shown in season 2 when he freaks out after his cancer goes into remission because he no longer has a justification for his criminal activity."
t1_cqevg02,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"The finale of Breaking Bad was 3 episodes long. In *Ozymandias*, we got to see Walt's world come crashing down around him. In *Granite State*, he was sent to a sort of purgatory, forced to finally confront the awful things he had done, instead of continually running from them.   *Felina* wasn't an example of Walt becoming an ""Avenging Hero"". Only in that episode did he fully understand the extent to which his actions had ruined so many lives. He was taking his biggest skill - solving problems - and applying it to the purpose of atoning for his sins, in whatever small way he could.   As for the ""I did it for me"" speech: however thoroughly Walt had convinced himself that he was doing everything to provide for his family, the truth is it was fueled by greed, ambition, and a lifetime of feeling stifled and meek. It was entirely selfish of him to continue in the drug trade after the events of the first 3 episodes. That speech was the only time he was actually honest with Skyler - or anyone - about his motivations. "

Criminals are regularly thrown through windows and walls without any lasting harm. Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.  &gt; In DKR Batman organizes a mass assault on Bane, knowing the police are using guns, and Bane's troops are using guns, which leads to a lot of deaths.

The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.  "

I don't believe a relationship can stem from adoration if one adores the other, but when both adore each other I think it can only end well (i.e. Onodera and Raku.) While I appreciate that later on Chitoge can acknowledge her feelings, that is indeed one-sided. Onodera's constant success in the popularity polls is clear evidence to me that most are in agreement of Onodera's superiority.  To appease the Tsugumi/Marika people, I will say that Tsugumi is not fitting at all because she does not develop as a character period and remains the in-denial tsundere the entire way through, and I already covered how I don't believe one-sided adoration can ever work out in the end.

I'm glad you said this, because it is actually an extremely common reason for your belief.   There's lots of reasons someone would pick this method, and a lot of reasons why the fail at it.  1 - access.   Not everybody has access to a gun, car, etc.   2 - How you will look.  Suicides are extremely tragic to family members, and people who commit suicide are aware of this. They generally hate themselves already for being such a burden, and don't want mom to walk into the bedroom with brains splattered all over the walls. Pills are among the cleanest suicide methods.   3 - knowledge  Overdosing on pills is HARD to do well. You don't need a controlled substance - lots of over the counter meds will do it.   You had this friend in high school who tried it previously, that means he was probably 16 at most when it happened. He likely had no idea what he was taking, or how much would be required to kill him.  4 - pain  Just because I'm dying doesn't mean I'm not going to feel it.

The time stamp of that correlates to the time stamp of Zimmerman on the phone to 911 saying ""OK"" and returning to his truck.

We can only rule on the evidence, and the evidence shows a thug on top of zimmerman beating the shit out of him.  Any reasonable person would respond with force in this scenario.  Remember you have to prove he is guilty. He doesnt have to prove his innocence, that is the default.  &gt;No, that's called menacing. It's a crime in Ohio at least. LOL no its not.  You need to look up the legal definition.     &gt;He was what's called negligent.   For fucks sake you cant just make up the definition of shit moron.  Its not negligent to shoot someone beating the shit out of you.     Its amazing how you have to pathetically make shit up and twist the definitions of everything to try and prove zimmerman is guilty.   Zimmerman was in the middle of a fight where he got his nose broken and head smashed into the concrete by a larger athletic younger man who had him in a mounted position raining strikes down at him.  What would a cop do in this scenario?   Oh yeah... fucking shoot you.  Which is exactly what a citizen should do to defend themselves too.   Doesnt even matter who started the fight.   You are required by law to stop attacking someone the moment you can.   Clearly thug Martin didnt stop attacking and get off of zimmerman from a mounted position while he screamed for help, so he got his ass shit.   He got shot due to his own poor thug decisions.  "

Naaawww... better hunt him down, break his nose, and smash his head into the ground without knowing his intentions.    If I was a neighborhood watch person and witnessed a stranger snooping around my neighborhood, I would follow them too, call the police and try to keep following them so I could point them out when the police arrived.  Thats perfectly reasonable.  If the person then turns around a violently attacks me, yeah, Ill shoot them dead.   Do idiots really believe Zimmerman had an intention to shoot him? You dont call the police if you intent on killing someone in the next few minutes, DERP.    Two of them women on the jury have had CCW permits.  They are going to put themselves in Zimmermans position, and easily conclude they would do the same thing after taking DAMAGE  The kid is a violent thug, that decided to teach whitey a lesson just because he followed him.

t1_caybyz3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0," According to the stand your ground laws you don't have to retreat, TM had every right to be in that neighborhood.  I guess if it was a woman being followed by a creepy ass cracker, she should just wait until she is attacked, no if she is fearful enough she could use whatever means available to protect herself. In fact GZs friend (Taffy) that is on CNN every night used this same argument. In addition its the similar to what GZ defense is using in that he felt the beating he was taking was life threatening. We know now that his injuries were nowhere close to being life threatening. But what we do know that GZ knew is that police were on their way and people were around, I will admit that is unfair for me to say that as I wasn't the one that got punched, hindsight is 20/20.   For me it comes down to George Zimmerman is an **adult and trained neighborhood watchman**. GZ knew TM was a kid. At some point he should have identified who he was as he had plenty of opportunity. He should have never left his car, IMO he left his car to catch TM, there was no other reason for him to leave his car in the rain. He needs to be punished for his incompetence.  Please don't assume you know what I base my position on, I very mixed emotions on the entire thing and have gone back and forth on my position. And how the media spun it had really no affect on me. One guy is dead and the other guy life is probably ruined. Both could have and should have made better decisions, however one was an adult, the other was a kid.   You should really refrain from calling TM a thug, racist, street fighter, drug dealer etc..  Ultimately with the facts on your side it those things should not matter one bit, it could have been the Pope and it would have been justified.  GZ has a history of his own.  "
t1_caywd53,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,"You clearly havent been following the case then.   George was nearly back to his truck when attacked.  It was clearly Trayvon that decided to FOLLOW HIM.  Then we have witnesses stating Trayvon was on top beating him.  His knuckles showed damage.  Zimmermans none. Zimmerman has damage on his face and back of his head.  This was an open and shut case of a thug getting mad that he was being watched and then decided to become an attacker and got shot.  Soon we will find there were drugs in his system. MJ for sure.  The police let Zimmerman off almost immediately because it was the right thing to do. A trial was a complete waste of time and money in an obvious case of self defense stock full of evidence.    The ONLY reason this went to trial is because the media lied and hyped it up for profits.  Zimmerman is going to walk, because he is clearly innocent.  Trayvon is dead because he has a track record of violence, drug use, racism, acting like a thug street fighting, gold teeth, texting about drugs, striking bus drivers, getting caught at school with stolen property and thieves tools, etc.  He was a thug that attacked an innocent armed civilian and got himself killed.

t1_casqjde,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; Martin was 17, he wasn't about to beat a man to death.  Regardless of whether or not Zimmerman is guilty, you have no way of knowing how the fight would have ended. Simply because he was 17 does not mean he was incapable of beating a man to death. In an alternate scenario, if it is true that Martin was bashing Zimmerman's head into the sidewalk, then Martin's actions (if he continued what he was doing) could very well have resulted in Zimmerman's death.

Well a little, but more as a suggestion for when she gets out. He hasn't attempted to be with her sexually, which is a lot more than a good chunk of the other guards can say.   Healy may be bigoted and racist, but not outwardly to the inmates themselves. I think he does care about his job and the girls, and his attitude reflects more of a problem with many white american men, but not as a counsellor. "

I do certainly see that he is supposed to represent a specific type of white american man, but I think that type of man makes a horrible counsellor because he is so caught up in his own shit that he doesn't see when people are really hurting (Soso) "
t1_cscf2qw,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Few people went partly because there was a rumour going around that it was about snitching on other people to Healy. It really could have been helpful for Poussey, she wanted to reach out but she couldn't because Suzanne was there to make sure she didn't 'snitch'. Healy still tried to change his behaviour and do something he thought could genuinely help the inmates.  You also have to remember that a prison counsellor isn't the same as a counsellor on the outside. A prison counsellor is not a therapist and may not even be able to tell someone is suicidal compared to being severely depressed, let alone provide the level of care needed for someone who is seriously considering suicide. His job isn't the same as an 'outside world' counsellor. He made a recommendation for Soso to get antidepressants, and without that recommendation she may not have gotten any medication whatsoever. Antidepressants have to be closely monitored by a medical doctor at the start of the course. That she didn't receive that care isn't Healy's fault, because he is not in any way qualified to monitor someone's reaction to medication, which often includes increased suicidal urges to begin with."
t1_cscg2p4,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Soso overdosed on meds that she stole from the Dr's office- Healy sent her to the Dr, the Dr's incompetence is the reason a pile of unattended pills was left in a room where a prisoner could grab them if she wanted them.    Having said that, I feel like they do a decent job with that character.  He is supposed to be helping inmates, but he has been there a long time, and people who are in positions like that have something similar to battle fatigue where they become less compassionate and more suspicious of games.    I think that he realizes that he made some terrible moves in Season 1 &amp; the beginning of Season 2, and is trying/ did try to help.  He had that Circle group with Penn, and he tries to help Red when he can.    Like many people, he is actually a combination of decency and selfishness or pettiness.    He may not be the best at his job, but he isn't the worst.  And in that system, sometimes the one who isn't selling drugs &amp; having sex with inmates, etc, is the one who is ""good"" at his job, by comparison.    Although, my vote for the one prison guard who seems to actually be good at his job would have to be Ford.  Because, other than leaving Morello in the van with Miss Rosa to see why the alarms were going off when Vee broke out, I can't think of a single bad move that guy has made.  "

I don't think he should've showed such lack of discipline towards alcohol when he knew explicitly there was an old flame who was into him.  I feel like I'm in the wrong here to blame him at all.  I think the answer probably has something to do with the logistics of victim-blaming and why that's wrong.  I could also be convinced that the alcohol makes it not his fault.  I think the root of my inability to see him as blameless comes from how similar the individual seems to myself as a male near his age.  I would hold myself accountable **to a degree** in his situation.    With that said, it's real shitty what happened to him, and the lady involved deserves 94.5% of the blame, as well as some kind of litigation if possible.  I apologize for slow responses, but it is kind of late here and this is a serious topic, so I would like to try to think through my responses entirely.    Please, CMV!  Edit 3:  sheep74 was the final straw that won me over.  While I would personally blame myself in the situation, I am in no place to judge and owe him the benefit of the doubt, the same as I would with anyone else.  Thanks for the good responses from everyone.  sheep74 just happened to be the final response that clicked  Edit:  Description is gone in that other link, sorry.  If anyone has it for reposting, that would be cool.  I apologize if I make any inaccurate claims about the story now that it's gone.  Edit2:  Original text below.  Thanks Shaabaaab for providing it again:  ""Since the original text is deleted, here's the text form the original post: Throwaway account. First of all, I am a 24 year old male, engaged to my girlfriend (now fiance) of 6 years. We are in a great place and are getting married in October. Last night I went to my best friend's birthday party. My fiance is out of town til Tuesday. I arrived around 1030pm after pre-gaming with two other friends, so when I arrived I was pretty sloshed. I remember arriving. I also remember running into a girl, we'll call Mandy, I had known in high school. We had dated briefly and she was my first blowjob back then. Anyway. We caught up and all that, and I remember her being particularly flirty. I told her I was engaged and even showed her pictures of my fiance. Then, I went about my night. I remember my best friend pulling me aside and told me that Mandy was wanting to hook up with me, and was overly flirty. I was honestly pretty oblivious of her advances. Anyway, I kept drinking. Took several shots of Southern Comfort, and eventually blacked out. The only thing I remember after that is a quick flash of me vomiting out in the back yard. But something else happened. My best friend said he walked upstairs to grab a towel, because someone had thrown up in his kitchen. When he opened the door, apparently Mandy was giving me a blowjob. I was apparently just lying there, looked like I was asleep. In his drunken state, he didn't think much of it, so he shut the door. I woke up the next morning around 7am, alone. My pants were completely off, and I still had my shirt on. I found out later from my best friend he overheard Mandy on her way out telling someone we had sex. I was completely blacked out, probably even passed out. I was definitely raped. I don't know what to tell my fiance. I'm trying to keep it under wraps. I'm afraid she won't believe I was raped. What do I do? TL;DR I was raped by an old flame at my friend's party. I have a fiance and I'm afraid of telling her in fear she won't believe me. Edit 1: Just called my fiance, told her I had something I wanted to talk to her about and not to worry. I just didn't want to pretend everything was normal til Tuesday. She is coming home early and will be back tomorrow evening. I've worried her, and now I'm even more afraid to tell her... Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your support. I'm still incredibly worried about telling my fiance. But it's gotta happen. I will post an update tomorrow night if I can. Honestly, I'm more worried about losing my love than I am hurt that it happened. I don't think I will need counseling, I'm a pretty level headed and rational person. NOT that people who do need counseling aren't! Just for me, personally, I don't think it would help much. Just a personal preference. Everybody copes differently. Edit 3: I just talk to my best friend. We both agree, it definitely appears I was raped. He says the more he think about it, the more he thought I was asleep or passed out when she was blowing me. He apologized for not stopping it, but was so drunk he just didn't think anything of it. He's willing to talk to my fiance is she needs proof. Also he is going to try and talk to Mandy soon. He's just thinking of a way to do it tactfully. I will also update with how that goes.""   &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

t1_ch33462,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,Are you saying you would blame the woman as you are blaming the man?
t1_ch33aph,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,That was part of the question; the situation is exactly the same but the genders are reversed.
t1_ch33yi9,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I'll have to disagree with you on doing the exact same thing.  The end result may be similar, but that does not account for what happens before and after the fact.  I can assess what happens to a certain degree to the male in the story because I'm about the same age and have drank while in a relationship.    I would similarly not be able to blame say a male getting more than he wanted in an S&amp;M situation simply because I don't know enough to properly assess that situation.  I think (perhaps wrongly) that I know enough to assess the situation at hand and place a small fraction of blame."
t1_ch30sac,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,"You should be allowed to expect other people not to rape you. It's pretty much as simple as that. He got wildly drunk under this perfectly reasonable expectation, and the fact that this expectation was not met is entirely the fault of the old flame.   Furthermore, he tried to show the old flame that he was not interested: he went so far as to show her pictures of his fiancee. If anyone should have refrained from alcohol, it was the old flame, as perhaps she knew that were she to be drunk and find him compromised, she would have a difficult time resisting taken advantage. But that's all on her, not on him.   One way to think about it is the example of people who wear clothes that can be called provocative. Even if this does increase the likelihood that they'll be raped (I don't know whether it does or not), they are not to blame in the least if they are raped. It's the same situation here: increasing the likelihood that you'll be raped does not make you at fault. Would you say someone walking around a dangerous area was to blame for being murdered? "
t1_ch32zj8,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"As I read it, the OP did not consent even when drunk. Those the consent is dubious not just because of the alcohol involved but also because I think there might not have been any consent whatsoever.   Furthermore, on Mandy's part, if she's partying with the secondary intention of banging the OP even after he's made it completely clear while relatively sober that he does not want to have sex with her, she is entirely to blame. The OP's lack of consent was not just implied (through an absence of active consent) but actually explicit. Now it's possible that Mandy was drinking with no intention of banging the OP but that after enough alcohol, she couldn't control herself even though she expected she would be able to. Then perhaps she's not entirely to blame, but any residual blame goes to the alcohol rather than to the OP.   Now, if you were to wake up in someone's bed after you had told that person explicitly while sober, ""I don't want to have sex with you,"" would you still be blaming yourself? Especially given that the other person initiated the act and you were too out of it to really do anything to prevent it? "
t1_ch36a9d,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"The problem here is that he definitely did not say ""yes, have sex with me"" under the definition of informed consent; if you aren't cognizant enough to remember what happened, you aren't cognizant enough to give consent. Even if he had said ""yes"" while blacked out, he didn't have the ability to consent. If you aren't in a state to know where you are and who with because you're that gone... you see what I'm getting at?"
t1_ch3gnvh,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"essentially it boils down to this.  Both parties talk while at a reasonable level of sobriety. At this point it's clear that one of them wants to bang (A) and one doesn't (B). At this point it's unreasonable for B to assume there's any danger, they are in control of their own decisions, they have rejected flirtation and they are in safe and comfortable surroundings. They also aren't going to assume that A needs to hear a clear 'no i will not have sex with you tonight' in order to avoid sex. Do you say that to everyone you meet just in case they get confused and think you want it? No, consent needs to be enthusiastic. For A to have any defense, B would have at one point need to actively engage in the idea of banging which clearly didn't happen.   Later B is so drunk that they black out. At this point, and even before, people are unable to consent to sex. Even if they say yes, it doesn't count because alcohol. At this point if anyone has sex with B it's pretty much rape (unless you get into the confusing situation where the other person was as drunk and both parties were fully involved in the act)  A is possibly also drunk, but clearly able to still move around. A friend, C, witnesses B pretty much passed out and unresponsive while A performs oral sex. It is clear that this is not a reciprocal session.   At this point it's pretty clear that A is more sober than B. B even seems unable to drunkenly consent. A had already asserted their intentions, and B theirs. They conflicted yet A has ignored this.  Further evidence is that, while B wakes up unable to form words or thoughts, A is already up and driving. This indicates enough disparity between their drunkeness that A is entirely culpable for what happened.  Maybe if sober A wouldn't have done it. But do we excuse men who hit their wives only when drunk? Or people who murder under the influence of crazy drugs? No, A's state does not impact the fact they committed a crime. "
t1_ch3kgyz,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I think I did, sorry.    I appreciate that you acknowledge the ambiguity, and still bring it around to being out of his control.    While I would blame myself if I was in that guy's position, it's not my place to fairly judge and thus I should give him the benefit of the doubt.  Even if I'm able to understand his situation better, I'm still not able to enough to do so fairly.  &amp;#8710;  Lots of other great responses that brought me to this point, but I think this is the one that finished the job."
t1_ch3m71x,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"So if Mandy had gotten into a car instead of hopped on his dick, that would've been okay because she wouldn't have been cognizant enough to realize that she was too drunk to drive?  It doesn't take much cognizance to realize that someone is slipping in and out of consciousness, and he had given no indication prior to becoming drunk past being able to give informed consent that he wanted her to do things to him."
t1_ch3p1te,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"There is a line between ""drunk"" and blackout, not conscious drunk. When you are so drunk that you can't stand, don't remember the next morning, and aren't even conscious half the time, active sex can't happen. If one party is that drunk, and sex still happened, it implies the other party was not.  In the situation you mentioned, you might be too drunk to safely operate a motor vehicle, but not too drunk to consent. If both parties were equally drunk, however, then they were both equally able to consent."
t1_ch33rrs,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I'm confused as to what your point is.    Are you implying that if he's blacked out he doesn't share responsibility for sex?  Are you implying him being impaired gets him out of responsibility for sex?    The way I see it, he gets out of complete responsibility if and only if he was **passed out** at the time of blowjob and sex.  Not blacked out, passed out.  However since there's no way of confirming a distinction, it seems unfair to assign 100% blame to Mandy.    Sorry for the misunderstanding "
t1_ch33u0t,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"I'm saying he was in no physical state to be able to consent; therefore it was rape and he has no responsibility, hence the ""conscious"" clause in my other post.  Also, if we can't tell how passed out he is, the Mandy should have 100% of MAKING SURE he has the ability to consent, not do it anyway and hope for the best."
t1_ch30u5o,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; I don't think he should've showed such lack of discipline towards alcohol when he knew explicitly there was an old flame who was into him.  That's like saying: ""She was asking for it going out of the house dressed like that"".   People have the right to be stupid and make bad decisions without being sexually assaulted. "
t1_ch3fpaz,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Again, like I said, the courts will label it sexual assault.  Bringing a legal definition means nothing in the context I laid out.  Criminal - another term that means nothing outside a court definition.    "
t1_ch3j0r0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"He wouldn't be charged if nobody knew whether or not the girl was passed out.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but all we have to go by is his drunk friend saying he *looked* passed out.  Man definitely should get busted in that scenario.  We are aware she was passed out.  Here we are not.  "

If you have a different definition, tell me, but this is the one I like to use.  Him drinking did not make her rape him.  He didn't trigger a rape instinct in her that made her lose control of her actions.  Him drinking did not affect her at all, so she had no reason to commit a crime against him.  Therefore, he is not responsible.  It's a good idea not to get black out drunk, but that makes him thoughtless, not responsible.

If a corporate advert post does not meet that criteria, reddit will downvote it, as it should. I think downvoting a humorous or interesting post just because it seems to be an advertisement is immature. A company who can capture my attention deserves for me to check them out, **ESPECIALLY** if they are able to do so on reddit.   [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1t748s/makes_me_laugh_every_time_i_drive_by/) is an example of a post that's most likely an advert from the company pictured.

It was funny to me which is relevant to the topic of that subreddit. Does it make me want to check out their product? Possibly. That isn't a bad thing though and is secondary to me enjoying the post.

t3_302atl,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"In the television series *King of the Hill*, Nancy has an affair with John Redcorn for several seasons. Her husband, Dale, never finds out. Joseph, the son of Nancy and John Redcorn, also never finds out.   I have three related arguments. 1) Hank should have told Dale about the affair and 2) Someone (Nancy?) should have told Joseph who his real father was.   Hank is supposedly one of Dale's best friends, and as such should have told his friend about the ongoing constant cheating that was occurring under Dale's roof. Instead, Hank sits back while Dale raises a kid that's not his own, and constantly is made to be a fool while John Redcorn gets to bang his wife.  Likewise, Joseph grows up without any of the knowledge from his native american father, without his real father's advice and traditions. It is likely that one day Joseph will find out that he is half native american - it would be much better if he found this out from his own mother while he had a chance to share his childhood with his real father. Instead, he had to go through puberty and enter early adulthood with only the squirrely Dale as his role model.  That Hank never tells his best friend tarnishes Hank's character. Hank comes off as a selfish promoter of the status quo with no real maturity to do the right thing. Hank doesn't care about Dale at all, and only puts up with him (and patronizes him) to proliferate the ""peace"" of the neighborhood. But, in almost every other part of the show, Hank is shown to be a mature caring individual who has the resolve to do the right thing no matter what. Not only should Hank have told Dale because that's what best friends do, Hank should have told Dale because it fits his character.   "
t1_cpojaxi,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,&gt; Dale is dirt stupid.  He's also dramatic.  Freaks out over the tiniest thing with some conspiratorial backdrop to every grievance.  I almost wonder if he'd believe Hank given how skeptical he is of everything that makes sense.

Even once he and Nancy break up and you'd think now is the time for him to do tell Joseph without caring about upsetting Nancy, he doesn't. Why? Again - either A or B above. "

As for his paranoia easy to think something in his past broke his trust in the government, now look at him. Imagine if he lost his trust in women/ his wife. What would that do to his family?"

If he calls Nancy out or if he got caught cheating, they'd definitely get divorced and let's run down what would happen.  *  Dale has seen what divorce did to Bill.  Dale is old and crazy and pretty worthless- who would have him?  *  Dale would fuck up a good thing because Nancy is obviously the breadwinner which frees him up to be his crazy self and do the Exterminator thing in his spare time.  * Dale would 100% lose Joseph.  Redcorn wants to pursue a relationship with Joseph, and he's the biological father, *and* Nancy would probably start a more legitimate relationship with John... so Dale would be shit out of luck in the Joseph department.  Clearly Nancy is keeping the affair a ""secret"" because she's a weather girl in a small town and with that Scarlet A, she'd lose her job in a minute.  Also  &gt; The reason he's not in Josephs life is because he understands that Joseph is truly Dale's son in all ways aside from biologically.  Nope.

Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on ""the white man"".   Dale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons.   So it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people.   We also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.     Also, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.  And as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion).   He also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in ""ignorance is bliss"" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well.   If Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice). "

I get your point, but I think it was entirely reasonable of Hank to conclude that Dale couldn't handle this and that everybody would be happier/better off with the lie."

The senior class president, who is in charge of organizing reunions, had to write a refund check to everyone who had already purchased a ticket. I know that at least 50 people paid for tickets. So that means she has 50+ checks floating around out there for over $1,000. These checks do not show up on your online account statements until they have been cashed or deposited.   You might think people would go deposit these checks right away, but people are weird. Sometimes people wait weeks or even months to deposit a check. They just keep forgetting or something, I don't know. Anyway, that is a long enough time that you can't keep a rough mental record of what checks have been cashed and what checks are still out there.   Also, you have no control over *when* the checks get cashed. With your debit card, you know if you are running low. So you know not to use it. If you are running low and 10 people decide to cash their checks at once, you will get slammed with bounced check fees.   ----  edit: It might not seem like a big deal now, but I write a lot more checks now that I am out of school.

Seemed to me as just people who were drug addicts / alcoholics / etc. so anyway back to volunteering at the shelter. I ended up talking with a few guys about their lives and pasts and it was fascinating the things that they had done and also the unfortunate circumstances / decisions that led to where they are now. I also ended up playing a 3 hour game of chess which ended in a stalemate. Most of these guys were really intelligent and it surprised me to some degree. Anyway after that my view of those who are homeless has shifted a lot to seeing each person as an individual with their own unique past and not simply as a collective of people who are homeless, and that there are a lot of hard working homeless people out there who have jobs and families but they just can't afford the cost o living.

t1_caumnu6,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,"I don't follow the case but I can suggest a couple points based off of what you talked about  &gt;What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week, had no means to defend himself while pinned downed in a ground and pound position  There is an immense difference between training and what you perceive as a life or death situation. You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.  &gt;What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, ""you're going to die tonight.""   Well the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation."
t1_caunbp5,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt; What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week  It sounds like he just started, although I can't find a good source for this. One headline said ""In the weeks before the shooting,"" but I can't find out exactly what they mean. Let's say that's about a month.  I don't think you can reliably escape mount after 12 mma classes against a stronger opponent in a stressful situation. I don't think you could do so after 12 classes of straight ground grappling where you had spend a fair portion of the time on obtaining/escaping mount.   &gt; What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, ""you're going to die tonight.""   I'm sitting on your chest, which makes it a bit harder to breath to begin with. I grab your neck with my right hand and pound your head on the ground. I reach for your gun with my left hand. My mouth is still free for trash talking.   I doubt that he would be simultaneously choking and slamming GZ; most likely did one, then the other. If I was choking you and you moved your head forward, I could slam you back down, but you wouldn't want to do that because moving your head forward would put even more pressure on your throat.  &gt; What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?  Maybe he's done more bad stuff than that. Weed was just the only thing he got caught for.

He runs towards you with the bat. You shoot him.   Under your legal analysis, did you escalate the situation and therefore the robber is acting in self defense?

t1_cb1j4c4,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Fair enough, and although we disagree, that's why you and I would never be in Zimmerman's shoes now, because we have common sense.  Conversely, something not being a crime doesn't mean that it might not cause someone to fear for his life. Certainly, walking around at night in the neighborhood where you're family lives is not a crime either, but Zimmerman thought Tryavon was a threat. I'm sorry, when someone is following me at night, for no reason, I'm fearing my safety, and I will defend myself.   Zimmerman will get at least manslaughter for creating a situation that caused anyone to fear for his life, not creating a narrative, just stating how most people would feel under the circumstances. Neighborhood watch people around the country will think it's alright to initiate confrontations, then claim self defense after murdering innocent people if Zimmerman walks. "
t1_cb1jo2k,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; I'm sorry, when someone is following me at night, for no reason, I'm fearing my safety, and I will defend myself.  no need to apologize.  i get where you are coming from.  you might be afraid, but you're in a floridian gated community, not east l.a.  what would you defend yourself from?  to defend yourself, there must be an act of aggression, and in this particular case, from what we know, there wasn't one on the part of the survivor.  initiating verbal contact is not an act of aggression you need to physically defend yourself from.  you seem to be suggesting the dead person was in fear for his life but it was not possible that the survivor was in fear for his.  if they were both in fear for their lives, and the dead person may well have been, idk, they both have the right to defend themselves.  and one guy came out better than the other.  "
t1_cb1kpaq,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"Alright, but one was following the other, not a crime, but nonetheless an aggressive action.   I don't feel Zimmerman is a monster, I just think he was paranoid, out to get someone apprehended, which caused his judgement to lapse, and caused him to think Martin was a threat, which in turn caused  him to follow the kid after Martin actually ran away. Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the ""pummeling""? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that.   Also, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy).   Also, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??  As for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.  Conservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:  ""Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.” http://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/  Finally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman ""somehow"" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential ""perp"" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.

t3_228jbo,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,"So, I attended summer camp from ages 8-16 and got heavily involved with the camp setting, and have worked most summers in between college semesters up at the camp I grew up at in a managerial capacity.  Growing up, the emphasis was placed on silly movie cliche's (Think heavyweights, Adams family values, camp nowhere) and the kids having fun, and if you were lucky you took something greater away from it but the goal was to have a good and memorable time.   Today though from my standpoint that culture has been lost in favor of a gigantic acceptance circle jerk. Pranks are no longer allowed because mom's got lawsuit happy but more importantly it's gone because it ""may"" hurt someone's feelings. In my particular case, it's a YMCA camp and while most of the staff is not religious, nor does the camp put heavy emphasis on Christianity in the first place however anything resembling Jesus including ultimately minor campfire song lyrics ect. have been removed because we are attempting not to force people to ""believe something"" Now, I have stated I'm not a religious person, but some of these things are simply a tradition, and the camp setting as a entity is all about tradition and honoring it. Lastly from my personal observations of the newer/younger staff from afar, it's sort of a catastrophic circle jerk, and if you break the jerk you are ostracized by the staff hive mind.    I don't think this is a good thing for the camp setting. I think kids going up to camp and skinning their knees, physically or emotionally is a good personal growth experience. Camp is a prime example of how adults have to operate in the real world, because sometimes you have to make things work with people you simply don't love or even like, and ultimately there are people that you do not simply HAVE to affiliate yourself with people who you feel are a detriment to your life.   Make no mistake, I don't think there's any room for bullying however; I don't think there's any crime in the boys doing something icky to the girls cabin  vice versa (silly string, shaving cream non damaging stuff that is ultimately harmless, but makes the kids feel accomplished in mischief.)  I think an important part of the culture is lost in the modern camp setting because we're too concerned with protecting the kids instead of giving them a positive but very real exposure to somewhat real life.  Please CMV.  "
t1_cgke088,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,"I went to and worked at the same camp for 11 years. From my understanding (and experience), camp is almost purely a social experience. When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about ""acceptance,"" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.  In regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before.   In regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals.   That's at least what I think about it anyway."
t1_cgke5cw,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"See, with the youngsters though they're completely uninterested in doing anything prank like in the first place. In my experience they're more concerned with farting in their bunks and falling asleep by 9PM sharp. lol. It's the 12-15 year olds who want to meet a cute girl or give the girls cabin a scare, and it's the 14-17 year olds who are purely concerned with the drama of the situation and want to meet someone instead of do activities.  I think a big problem with the setting is the advent of the ACA. I think personally that has been the biggest determent to the modern camp setting. It's brought in this idea of ""Camp that is corporate"""
t3_28o7uj,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"In a recent AskReddit thread, one of my pet peeves came up - someone ""admitting"" that they had a crush in third grade, or some comparable age.  I told myself that I had ""crushes"" on several girls throughout elementary school, I acted really strangely around them, I told people that I had these crushes, the whole shebang. But then puberty hit, and as I turned out to be gay, all of these crushes I thought I had on girls ended up not being genuine. I was wrong about what a crush was then, because I was 10.  So it truly does irk me that people say that they ""had their first crush in third grade"" or when Google makes an advertisement for their new tablet involving an 11 year old wanting to ""ask out a girl"". They don't know what a crush is. They don't even know if they're interested in people of that gender, not at that age.  I would love not to feel this way, as it would save me a lot of unnecessary anger toward people who don't mean to offend me. If you feel that you had a genuine crush before puberty, I would love to hear your point of view. Thanks!  "
t1_cicu5de,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"An eight year old boy says ""When I grow up, I want to be an astronaut.""  Of course, from his perspective, he genuinely means it. He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.  But that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say ""Awww"".  Childhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like ""play"", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself."
t1_cicu6hc,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"ooooooh interesting question. I felt like I had a lot of crushes when I was a kid. I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would ""ruin"" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said ""yeah, I know"" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends.   But even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?"

No shell casings. No recovered bullets. No pictures of a gunman. No reliable witnesses of more than one shooter. Nothing.  4) LHO killed a cop later that day. No one seems to ever bring that up.

Brewer (a store clerk who said he saw Oswald acting suspicious) was the one who reported him, not for not paying for the movie, but rather for acting suspicious.

Led an inquiry regarding the beating of a black homeless male, against a mostly white Sanford police department, publicly criticizing their procedure - Which led to the resignation of the police chief.  I think Zimmerman's view of any black out of the context is largely (not completely) irrelevant.  How does he feel about young black males on the streets of his neighborhood?, that is relevant. It is easy to make exceptions, exclusive or inclusive. ""my business partner is not like those other guys"" or ""these punks on the streets are not like my business partner.""   &gt;was it a factor of how Zimmerman assessed the situation?  if the burglars are known to be black then it should have been a factor for Zimmerman otherwise he is an exceptionally poor detective.   "
t1_cb3ecr8,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"&gt; The part that is in question is the ""looked suspicious."" Did trayvon being black have anything to do with him ""looking suspicious"".   If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.  Lets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support.   &gt;So my first question is do you think there is a sentiment in our culture that feels that black people look/are more suspicious?  Sadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social ""code"".   The fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.  I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate.   But the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem."

Connally, and did so as an individual actor (not as the agent of a nation or organized group). My knowledge of the Kennedy Assassination is admittedly limited; I've studied it in school and participated in several university level class discussions about the investigations and conspiracies surrounding the issue. After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts."

My theory is this...  - Oswald was the only shooter. All ""evidence"" for a second shooter can be explained away in a very logical way. I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.  - We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.  - I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.  - No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.  Again, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read. There are ""experts"" out there who would agree this is all plausible. What do you think?"

t1_cbujuoi,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Sorry for the delay in responding; life and such. Okay, you’re starting to convince me that there was more at play than I initially suspected, but I have a few more questions that you might be able to clear up.  * You’ve convinced me that Oswald acted alone, or at least plausibly could have made the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Gov. Connally. Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would’ve done poorly but still hit his target.  * I’m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You’re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don’t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn’t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn’t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60’s isn’t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn’t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a “patsy”) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).  * If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I’m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don’t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement? "

For example, in high school debate there are two key factors that are used- How you say it (speech) and what you are saying (facts, arguments).

Lucky is defined by having good luck, luck being the force that seems to operate for good or ill in a person's life, as in shaping circumstances, events, or opportunities. I'll give 2 examples: one with a lot of luck but no talent and another one with a lot of talent but no luck. 1. Jim lands a job interview that he recently found in the paper the second he opens it.

He finds that this attractive redhead is doing the interviews, seemingly her first time to be doing this so she is relatively laid back. Jim goes in her interview and does perfectly! He already knows all of the questions and talks in a smooth voice.  Now there is a portion to show coding.  After about 5 minutes she realizes that he doesn't know anything and tells him sorry. Now Bob walks in to another room that has a grumpy old man sitting there.  He asks the most difficult questions possible!

There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.  The extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.  So this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had."

They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses.

In both cases, no death was intended, but it happened because the cops/thief recklessly created a dangerous situation.

Real life is not like movies; you don't have showdowns where two people point guns at each other, unless both of those people are idiots.

I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.    After he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.    Even if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.  "

t3_2eyfoa,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,"SPOILERS FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T PLAYED EPISODES 4 AND 5 of THE WALKING DEAD GAME SEASON 2. SERIOUSLY DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT.  ---    So, to those of you who played the latest episodes, you know who Arvo is. He's the Russian kid whose group you get into a shootout with. Clementine ends up shooting his reanimated sister, much to his horror. He's then led around by an abusive Kenny who beats him *twice*. The first time in the woods was completely unnecessary, and the second time was too (he didn't lie about the food or the house - and Luke's death was gonna happen anyways).    By that point in the game, *everyone* was afraid of Kenny. He was clearly teetering on the edge of sanity, and Jane even mentions how Clementine may be the only one who can bring him back before he totally loses it.    So when he shoots Clementine, *everybody lost their shit.* IIRC he was voted the most hated character this season, even moreso than Carver. [There's even a whole sub dedicated to his hate now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckarvo) A lot of it is just circlejerking, but reading the discussion of these latest episodes on the net shows that a lot of people really did hate the kid for it.    But I think they're missing something really important...something Telltale Games seemed to spent a really long time trying to hammer into our heads.    After Clementine was shot and started dreaming about the RV ride with Lee, Clementine asks Lee ""why Lilly shot Carley (or Doug, depending on your playthrough)"" and Lee mentions how Lilly ""was sad."" ""That can make people angry sometimes.""    One of the responses is ""have you ever been that angry?"" To which Lee responds ""one time."" Presumably he's referring to when he murdered a state senator for sleeping with his wife, which was undoubtedly a crime of passion. Lee even mentions how people's actions might not make sense, ""because bad things happen to everybody.""    So I think with all the bad things that happened to Arvo, him shooting Clementine doesn't warrant all the hate he's getting. We all love Lee even though he did something just as bad; we can't judge Arvo for what little we've seen of him especially in his state.    **tl;dr: convince me to join the ""Fuck Arvo"" train**  "

In the context of the zombie apocalypse, ambushing and attempted murder aren't bad, but punching someone is?  &gt;I think that's only true because of how Kenny acted.   The problem was they took the Arvo ambush plot and tied it in to the ""Kenny is dangerously unstable"" plot when one does not organically lead into the other. Kenny's actions towards Arvo after the attempted murder were not unstable but perfectly reasonable.  &gt;What's wrong with the way he was written? He was given undue sympathy and trust from the group despite having no reason to be endeared to them?"

That was many a day's walk from where the group runs into the Russians. Arvo came to get Clem's group, they didn't stumble onto him.  &gt;How so? You could say the same about Carver.

What's the harm in hitting a piece of meat with a crowbar? It's not like him staying put the group in any danger."
t1_ck46us6,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"I think the root of the frustration and hate people feel towards Arvo is the lack of choice the game gives you. From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him.   Nevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.  Taking my play through as an example:  * Clem didn't steal from him * Clem didn't attack him * Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.  Arvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.  &gt;  Lee mentions how Lilly ""was sad."" ""That can make people angry sometimes.""  First off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.  Regardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person.   Christa had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.  &gt; We all love Lee even though he did something just as bad; we can't judge Arvo for what little we've seen of him especially in his state.  It is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.  What I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.  The entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.  I'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided. "
t1_ck47ebr,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"∆ okay, that part about the lack of choices towards Arvo makes sense. MisanthropeX touched on that, but you did a better job explaining why Arvo's actions towards you don't make as much sense depending on Clem's actions (poor storytelling on Telltale's part?).    But I'm still not convinced he's a terrible person.    &gt;Arvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.    Not ""sad"", more ""angry."" Kind of like Lilly.    &gt;Christa had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.    Christa also had history with Clem, so she knows that Clem didn't intend for Omid to die.    &gt;It is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.    But in Arvo's case, strangers (who almost robbed and killed him), killed his entire group and beat him up several times. He didn't hate Mike or Bonnie; only Kenny (for obvious reasons) and Clementine (who killed his sister, and though even as you mentioned she didn't necessarily do anything wrong towards him afterwards, you never really got to make up with him like others did - thanks Telltale!).    &gt;What I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him    He did unto you what you basically did to him.     &gt;Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with    Really? I think everyone was reasonable to fear Kenny by that point. Except leaving the house with all your supplies was a dick move, but not trusting Kenny anymore wasn't wrong. Only Clementine (and the player) knows that Kenny wasn't all that bad. "
t1_ck4kq73,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"This is exactly it, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the two series but the game gives you nothing but the illusion of choice, everything all gets wrapped up the same way and you have to go through these set plot events that don't really make sense depending on which choices you made just so there's no real branching paths in a game supposedly about storytelling and the like."
t1_ck4jqhn,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"If anyone deserves the hatred, it's Bonnie. She rips into Clem after the drowning and says something snide (at least in one option, I'm not sure about both) that ""it must be nice to be a pretty girl and not have to do anything"".  Bitch, are you high? Ever since you met Clem she's done all the work. Breaking you out of Carver's grasp, for one. What the hell did *Bonnie* offer?  So what does Bonnie do? Betray Clem and co at the earliest opportunity. And when their escape plan goes awry and Clem is shot, Mike doesn't know what to do, and Bonnie persuades him to bail. You know, Clem's bleeding out right there, but fuck it, Bonnie wants to leave.  Arvo didn't owe the group anything, and they beat him, killed his sister and his friends, maybe mugged him.   Bonnie, though? Jeez, Bonnie stabs Clem in the back so often she probably whistles in a light breeze."
t1_chk6r9i,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"Korra had many disadvantages too. I don't agree that age and experience gave Korra a significant advantage because Aang traveled around the world and had more ""real life"" experience. Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point.   I don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the ""final showdowns"": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after.   I strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals.   Lastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.  "
t1_chk6s8c,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,"I'm not sure that I would say one is definitively better than the other, but four years at that age makes a huge difference.  While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.    If we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.  Here's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.    &gt;Even in book 3 after a ton of ""character development"" (which Korra is not at yet), he tries to put off his inevitable showdown with Ozai.  This is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.  In reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.  Is he ""better"" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang."
t1_chk7ilh,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt;I know that I made worse and more selfish choices at 16 than I did at 12 despite having greater agency.  But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.  It's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.    &gt;they do not possess the same mentality that typical children do, due to having to ""grow up"" and adapt quickly.   Sure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to ""grow up"" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination.   At the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.    Basically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.    &gt;Toph didn't share this view  I disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.    I like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.    For a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.  The same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).  "
t1_chkg1f1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&amp;#8710;  I am new here, can I give more than one delta in a thread?  Largely because I don't have anything to say in rebuttal and you pretty much covered all the bases. The most compelling part of your argument is that 12 year olds can still say wise things, but you still cannot expect them to have the same moral agency as an adult even if they do act more mature than their age and participate in war. It's why juveniles and adults are not tried in the same courts in the real world. There are a few things here and there I don't agree with but they do not affect the integrity of your argument. I still have a personal preference for Korra the Avatar though :)  No, never really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first and part of the fifth book and watched the first and fourth movies."

t1_chk8ser,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"One of the big things that you are discounting is that Korra has had the support of family and friends for her entire upbringing.  she had actually teachers for every element who were wise experts themselves.  She had leadership and guidance through her entire upbringing and there was zero conflict for her whole upbringing.   Aang totally missed that element of childhood.  He is expected to be the Avatar with no training, no guidance, no nothing as a child.    If the nature argument doesnt sway you (age), i think the nurture argument should.  He didnt have really any of the resources Korra had growing up. "
t1_chkfbo3,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,"I don't agree there was zero conflict. She felt the White Lotus was confining her. All of the previous Avatars got to travel the world while she gets stuck in a compound where her life is scripted. She didn't have any friends her age until she got to Republic City whereas Aang references Kuzon, Bumi, and the other Air Nomad children. Aang wasn't confined or ostracized from his friends until he was told he was the Avatar. He doesn't know his parents as that is Air Nomad custom, but otherwise it seemed he had more of a childhood than Korra did, who was confined to her compound for training.   The scenarios are different. Aang was told he was the Avatar pretty late and he had not yet been trained. In fact, being taken away from Gyatso for Avatar training was literally the reason for running away. He didn't give it a chance.   I made another comment below - Aang refused the resources given to him until he was put in dire circumstances. It's different than not having had those resources at all. "
t1_chkxjvq,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"He had a childhood, yes, but not the kind of guidance that the Avatar needs.  The Avatar is never going to have a normal childhood.  Unless he is not known to be the Avatar until later on (like aang was).    Aang left because he was upset.  but he was just going out for a ride, I is not as if his intention was to incase himself in ice for a century.    When you are 12, and someone says that you are all of a sudden super important, and you cant be with your friends or your only father figure, that is going to be pretty tramatizing.  It was his intention to leave and cool down.  But even in the first book we see aang regreting his actions.  He did not intend to be gone long, just to cool off.    He didnt have the resources until he made them available to himself.  He didnt have any teachers or guidance, and the world was literally against him.  He had to seek out and find earth benders and fire benders to teach him.  not an easy thing to do when the fire nation wants you dead.    Korra had that support system.  I understand that she didnt have an ideal childhood.  But if you think that being in what was basically a boarding school where you learn to use super powers is the same as being hunted by an entire nation of people, you are very wrong.    Aang and Korra are also very differnt people.  Raised differently and with different mindsets and approaches to life.  I dont think one or the other is better.  I think they have different strengths and weaknesses.  I dont think Korra would have been capable of simply stopping Ozai.  And i dont think she would have been capable of learning from Zuko either.  But, i think she would have been able to learn from aang's first firebending teacher, even without mastery of earth.    So, they are different.  But i dont think korra is better.  that isnt to say that she is worse, i just think that they are different.   Some of Korra's character is wrapped around young adult love and ""who is going to take me to prom"" style stuff, but i dont think that is really who she is. so i am not really thinking about that. "
t1_chkbwxl,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,"You're comparing apples to oranges here.  Aang's story arc was acceptance of his role as the avatar.  Remember he only found out he was the Avatar a few days before he fled.  He was 12, and he was faced with this overwhelming burden of fighting a war. The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.    Korra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security.   Also, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.  Throw on the differences in age and training and I think it's really unfair to compare the two.  "

He wasn't believably annoying, he wasn't interestingly annoying, he was just annoying. He wasn't a ""flawed character"" because he barely even qualified as a character to me. Characters, to me, either need to have some sort of redeeming quality to them or otherwise serve some sort of purpose to the plot. The book hardly had a plot and was basically just some annoying guy wandering around the city doing random shit and saying stupid as hell things. It was just bad.  &gt; You could do that with virtually any fact and assume the person who doesn't know it is stupid.  Well then that's the other thing.

See, all I got out of it was that Holden was a massive hypocrite, a bit of an idiot, and mentally unstable. That was basically it. That is not, to me, an interesting character. The disjointed happenings the author used to beat those aspects of this character into my head for no other reason than ""because he's the main character"" were not something I found to be well written.  &gt; Is a character who is insane suddenly not interesting to read about?  Is a character that is insane supposed to suddenly *be* interesting to read about? My point is that all of his personality can be summed up by ""tragedy broke his mind and sent him into a spiral of idiocy and insanity."" He was an insane hypocrite. That's all he was and that is utterly one dimensional.  There wasn't, as I recall, much of a showing of who he was before he lost his mind, so it doesn't even make for a compelling tragic tale to me. He was just some guy that suffered a lose and completely broke down in the most mundane, drawn out, and utterly frustrating way imaginable. I was a teen with depression while reading this book, and I've had people in my life die too.

t1_cl6xdwv,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"&gt; Whether or not a character is stable doesn't determine how interesting they are and is irrelevant.  But my point is that's all he was. All of his issues can potentially be traced back to his instability.  &gt; Holden has issues no one addressed and no one cared about.  ...issues that stemmed from his instability.  &gt; He was directionless and suffering  ...because his brother died.  &gt; he perceives as fake and one dimensional  ..because he's unstable.  &gt; this was all building inside of him  ...ever since his brother died. He is completely and utterly defined by that one singular event. Yes, it was a tragic event, but we weren't shown how it effected him because we weren't shown the character he was before. All we saw was the aftermath, and so all we got was a one dimensional character with one defining trait - instability.  &gt; whether you liked Holden or not is your own opinion  Obviously. This is my interpretation of the book, and we're here discussing it because our interpretations differ. But also, I dislike it specifically because it is my own opinion that it is poorly written. The fact that a lot of people have written a lot of things about it only proves it's popular, not that it's well written. Well written is just as much of a subjective idea, and I'm entirely aware of that."
t1_cl88xn5,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"It reminded me of being younger and getting pissed when other people would Lauph at me for not knowing something that might be considered common knowledge, but somebody has to explain things to you at some point, my parents never taught me very much at all, I'm guessing holdens parents were always too busy to explain anything to him so he had no context. "
t1_cl89ogw,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"But I'd guess you weren't obsessed with a really well known answer to a specific question. Like, if it was so very important to him to know exactly what happened to the ducks, why, with the answer being such a well known fact, was he completely unable to ever get an answer to that? That's the part of it that bugs me more than anything, he was in a goddamn boarding school at the start of the book, you're telling me he couldn't find the answer to that question *at a school?*"
t1_cl89vmf,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,I think that's what the author is getting at. Nobody will help this kid with what is troubling him not even something so basic.
t1_cl8a4kq,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"But it seems like a very extreme and unbelievable example to use for that. Part of why I don't see it as a well written book. He seemed sincere to me, so barring the idea that he was asking to see if anyone would answer, and assuming he genuinely didn't know...why couldn't he have gone to the friggen school library and found a book about ducks or even ask the goddamn librarian. Or a teacher for that matter. It's literally part of their job to answer questions, so unless he was at a really shitty school, it should have been a piece of cake for him to get that answer."
t1_cl6aecx,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,"Holden is suffering.  His brother died, his parents neglect him, his friend committed suicide while borrowing his sweater.  That's not generalized teen angst.  He is struggling with his own mental illness, and is profoundly sad and lonely.  When he tries to reach out to an adult he trusts (Mr. Antolini), he learns he has ulterior motives.  I don't understand people who don't have sympathy for Holden.  Is it because he's rich?  And you think that people who come from rich families have no right to feel deep emotional pain?  This is a story of an abandoned child doing his best to navigate his world without any kind of guide.  What's more sympathetic than that?  As far as my own personal love for the book, I can tell you that when I read it as a teenager, I had an epiphany-like experience of feeling like someone else in the world might actually understand me.  I was neglected, I was mentally ill and not getting treatment, and when Holden said it was the kind of cold where you felt like you were going to disappear every time you crossed the street, I thought *""Oh my God, somebody GETS me.""*  This book isn't for everyone, but for some people it is a profoundly validating experience.  Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.  But Holden's voice is so true to how so many of us feel, when we read that book we feel as if J.D. Salinger has reached out and held our hand. "
t1_cbogk1v,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,"Tolkein directly addressed this sort of point in his letters.  &gt;Frodo deserved all honor because he spent every drop of his power of will and body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no further. Few others, perhaps no others of his time would have got so far. Letter 192.  &gt;""The power of the ring would reach its maximum - impossible, I should say, for anyone to resist, especially after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted."" Letter 246  http://www.americanidea.org/handouts/06240110.htm  &gt;'If you re-read all the passages dealing with Frodo and the Ring, I think you will see that not only was it quite impossible for him to surrender the Ring, in act or will, especially at its point of maximum power, but that this failure was adumbrated from far back.' 191  So it's quite possible that no one else would be strong willed enough to bring the ring to the mountain (though in the past individuals who could existed) and he was likely the most strong willed of the people nearby. The taxing journey would have also severely weakened people's ability to destroy it. Frodo had long since been corrupted and it would have never been possible for him to destroy it, even with a burst of will.  As to whether Sam could have done it.   &gt;""Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dur. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be""  Sam was also being corrupted. I don't know if he'd have been able to throw it in.   &gt;'No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn't failed, not yet. I took it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I've kept it safe. It's round my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.' Sam fumbled for the Ring and its chain. 'But I suppose you must take it back.' Now it had come to it, Sam felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again.  &gt;'You've got it?' gasped Frodo. 'You've got it here? Sam you're a marvel!' Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. 'Give it to me!' he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. 'Give it me at once! You can't have it!'  &gt;'All right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!' Slowly he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. 'But you're in the land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the Firey Mountain and all. You'll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?'  He already found it very hard to hand it over."
t1_cbognd1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"No one showed to be totally immune-- But several resisted the ring's corruption from varying proximities for varying times. Faramir ultimately resists the same corruption that Boromir couldn't-- Sam carries the ring for some time and willingly returns it to Frodo--  I think the very fantasy of Samwise being this great conqueror is the Ring's Stock corruption gambit, but it's really out of Sam's character. I doubt he was considerably tempted by that fantasy, even if he was a little. "
t1_cboiu19,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"1. Frodo wouldn't have surrendered the ring willingly. Sam would have likely had to kill him.  2. Sam had worn the ring briefly, which would have likely corrupted him.  Anyway, if he had tried it what I suspect would happen would be that Frodo would have put in the ring and fought with him, likely killing Sam as Sam wouldn't be willing to take the steps to win but Frodo would. Then he would have tried to escape until Sauron found him and took it, regaining his power.  I suppose there's some small chance that Sam would have succeeded, but it's hardly certain."
t1_cbomaor,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"True fact, but he is some form of higher order being-- there are theories that he's a god and the like-- so he doesn't really contribute to the hypothetical discussion on the ring's affects on mortals. "
t1_cbogq70,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,You didn't read my post all the way through.
t1_cboi8d2,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,"&gt; Gollum hadn't even attacked at the point of Frodo putting the Ring on and turning away from his goal.  So it's *you* who hasn't seen the movie or read the book in awhile. Golum attacks them on the mountain and it is what separates Frodo and Sam in the first place. The entire situation you describe them in only occurs because of Golum, hence the hypothetical.   You may have misunderstood my post but it's fairly straightforward."
t1_cboisgm,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Admittedly it's been a while since I've seen the movie, so I did forget about Gollum's first attack outside the chasm. That still doesn't change much of what happened. Frodo still would have likely put the ring on and left Sam. Until that point, Frodo was already cracking at the seams and Sam wasn't holding up well either.   If Sam's energies weren't spent fighting Gollum, it would have been spent hauling Frodo up. Also, the speculative willpower Frodo may or may not have had is kind of immaterial. If anything, the Ring had proven that its power to survive was strengthened at Mount Doom as it easily corrupted others.   Tolkien is even on record saying Frodo could not have given the Ring up at that point. In one of his letters he even said it was his intent to show  ""the power of Evil in the world is not finally resistible by incarnate creatures, however 'good'"". "
t1_cboh71d,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Gollum's tale is one of power corrupting and eventually causing its own self-destruction. While the tale might have worked without his intervention at the end, it's important for *his* arc, not just the hobbits'. His greed for the ring eventually led to the ring's destruction and his own."
t1_cbp7hcg,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,It should be noted that the ring is a symbol of state power(http://disinfo.com/2012/12/the-hobbit-as-anarchist-anti-state-manifesto/)  So the question how the ring can be destroyed is a question of how can state power be destroyed; is it destroyed by good leaders freeing their subjects or is it by mismanagement and outside forces?
