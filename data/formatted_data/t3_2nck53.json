    "body": "The title says most of what I want to say, but to elaborate a bit, there seems to be a lot of outrage over the fact that Darren Wilson was not indicted, not just among members of the community but abroad, and I'm not quite sure where it's coming from.  Initially, it seemed as though Brown may well have been fleeing from the scene and was shot without posing a threat, but as new information has been released that seems less and less to have been the case.  Part of me thinks the outrage is largely due to the fact that people have associated Mike Brown with a greater (and admittedly perfectly legitimate) problem, namely that of police targeting of black youth.  Now that he's so strongly associated with that problem, it seems like people don't want to admit that perhaps Brown did at least reasonably seem to pose a threat because it would feel like they're betraying a cause they care a lot about, even if to admit that would be the more reasonable position to take.\n\nChange my view.",

My belief isn't even that Wilson was acting purely in self defense; my position is that it is *sufficiently likely* that Wilson was acting in self-defense, and that as a result he should not be put in jail.",

If he was rushed at, which as far as I'm aware is a perfectly reasonable possibility, shooting would have been the right thing to do despite the fact that he had tried to maintain a reasonably safe distance.\n\nIf you're talking about the altercation at the car, I don't think that's fair at all. An officer can't be expected to stay 50 feet away from absolutely everyone he confronts.\n\nActually though I see something here that might change my view.  What do you think the proper protocol was?  How should Wilson have handled the situation?  As far as I could see, Wilson was taking the most reasonable options available to him, or at least there's reason to believe he may well have been.  If I see something else that was more reasonable, though, I think I would change my view.",

Once he was physically attacked,  when other officers were on the way,  chasing Brown closely was escalating. \n\nWas Wilson guilty for ignoring procedures that would have prevented the death of brown? No.  Police don't need to follow procedure in order to be allowed to use their weapons. But was it his fault?  Absolutely. ",

You're ignoring the possibility of juror bias against prosecuting a cop, or prosecutorial bias affecting the way the grand jury was presented evidence. You're ignoring the fact that the prosecutor never even suggested a charge and just told the jury to figure it out themselves.

It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.\n\nThis cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on. I don't dispute that Brown scared him at some point, but he approached this in a way that escalates situations, not defuses them as police are trained to do. Had Brown not died, it's more likely he would have received punishment for how poorly this situation was handled.",

Wilson just had to say that he was concerned that Brown might attack another cop coming from the other direction and he had covered himself. http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7175967/darren-wilson-charges-michael-brown-ferguson",

But here are some points we can move along on. \n\n1)Cops are trained to subdue people. This is true, but they are also trained to be physically fit, courteous/professional, and competent in the law. However, most cops rarely get more than 6 months of training. Taking into account that 6 months of doing anything puts the average person at a skill level of just above novice, we have to know what their abilities are. Cops will not be able to stop an assailant without causing serious injury or death. Just like anyone else, they are entitled to kill if an assailant presents them with the intent to harm/kill them. Police do not magically have the ability to subdue criminals.\n\n2)Killing someone is rarely the best option. But we hardly choose our circumstances, especially when our assailants force those circumstances on us. We have to recognize that police officers being attacked can not change circumstances simply because they have been trained. They are just like any other average person. And so they should be given the right to defend themselves just like any other average person.\n\n3)If cops should/ought to be the type of people to be able to prevail over these kinds of circumstances then we need to either extend the rights of the average citizen as to make the service of police obsolete or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers. I think that in order to satisfy your standard of what an officer should be able to do, we need to train them to be on par with special military forces. The problem with that is that we give the government a paramilitary force in small towns. \nImagine if you will: Police are trained to a standard such that they can physically subdue someone 100lbs heavier than them. Do we really want every police officer in our town to have that much power? Do we want government giving orders to such people? Police forces are already corrupt but now they have the physical power to act with impunity. I guess this is where my facism thing ties in.\n\nIn short, we either need to give more rights to citizens so that police are obsolete and we can avoid police brutality or we must train police to be on par with the military and risk giving government and police too much power.\n\n",

As it stands, you're handing glass cannon (easily made useless, but irresponsibly powerful) omniphobes a gun and pushing green cops onto dangerous streets. \n\n2) Training is there to give you agency when your frontal cortex just cant get the time to react rationally. We train them to stay alive, but not how to deal with the people they're there to serve and protect. \n\nAnd I agree with all of it until the \"just like any other average person\". Regardless of it's source, \"with great power comes great responsibility\" is so true here it hurts. They have the power to walk around with lethal weapons, and we trust that they use them to defend the innocent and especially as a tool to de-escalate a situation already out of control. Even from his own counts, Brown was at one point running from his car and he decided to get out. What had happened if instead of just missing him with the first shot (Wilson's own account), that he'd hit someone else on the street? Is taking down one robbery suspect worth that? He was confident enough in his own aim to miss bystanders and hit Brown. He was wrong on one account. Thankfully it wasn't worse.\n\n3) \n&gt; or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head, but bend it later on.\n\nNot only do officers need such training that they can subdue a person 100 lbs their gravitational superior, but behavioral and psychological training to not only pick out the assholes, but gain the ability to swallow their pride if it means everyone walks away unharmed.\n\nYou know what though, I realize what I'm looking for in a cop after all this. I'm looking for what I was taught cops were when I was a kid: heroes in blue. The men and women who put their lives on the line to keep safe the people of the town they protect. Instead, we get glorified town guards with itchy trigger fingers and a penitent for bullying unsatisfied since high school. Is it actually that clear cut? No, of course not, but the pendulum has swung further towards \"deuchbadge\" than \"officer hero\".",

Obviously police cannot arbitrarily search people and places without a warrant or proper suspicion, which is part of our system of due process.\n\nHowever, if an individual is innocent and happens to match the profile of a suspect that just fleed the scene of a crime nearby, running away or tussling with the cop is not the appropriate response. There is a legal process to handle this. If someone just robbed a bank—or a convenience store—for example, the police should not just give up because the suspect isn't going to play nice and submit to questioning or arrest. If this happened, criminals would always just run away, and the police would be powerless because to do anything more would be to \"escalate.\"\n\nMichael Brown did not want to go to jail for what he had just done, I would imagine. In all likelihood, if he had submitted to arrest, he would have been in jail for a few hours—or a few days max until he was bailed out—and then given a fine, community service, and probation (of course he may have feared he'd spend the next six months in jail); his crime was not the most serious. Unfortunately, if the testimony and gunshot evidence is indeed all accurate, he doubled down on the stupid and decided to fight back against the police officer.",

Minutes later, he was walking down the middle of the street with his friend/accomplice. Darren Wilson's side is something like he initially told him to get out of the middle of the street and then realized he fit the suspect profile for the robbery, so he confronted the pair again which is when Brown became aggressive.\n\nMy initial knee jerk was that this sounded like another example of police brutality towards minorities, but after following the story over the past few months, I became increasingly convinced Wilson was probably justified.

He probably got out of the car and started shooting from where he was. I doubt he can shoot and run at the same time. If he was running after Brown he would have to holster his gun or run with his gun drawn, both of which would make him run more slowly than Brown who had a head start and probably in fear for his life.\n\nI believe the testimony that Wilson was shooting at Brown while he was running away, because it's the most reasonable explanation for why Brown turned around and put his hands up.\n\nSo from what I can piece together, Wilson was probably 30-40 yards away from Brown and Brown with his hands up, walking a few paces forward. If these are the facts then Wilson, a trained police officer, was clearly not in imminent danger.\n",
