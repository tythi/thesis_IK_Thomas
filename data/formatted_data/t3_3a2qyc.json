    "title": "CMV: Brock Lesnar was the greatest ever UFC heavyweight champion. (Spoilers)",
    "body": "This is probably an unpopular opinion among mma fans, but I think a strong argument can be made.  There's never been a truly dominant heavyweight champ in UFC, unlike lower weight classes. In fact nobody has ever successfully defended the hw title more than twice during a single reign.  The only other contenders for GOAT so far would be Cain Velasquez and Randy Couture, who also won 2 title defenses in a row.  (Technically Couture won 3, but during separate reigns.)  \n\nNow some might argue that Cain and Randy are better because they are multiple-time champions (so is Tim Sylvia), but in both those cases they weren't able to get 2 straight until their second reign. Brock did it in his one reign, and with considerably less experience.  Plus both Lesnar's successful defenses were against interim champs in their own right (and he's the only hwc to ever defeat an ihwc).  One of them was against a man who had already beaten him (Mir), and the other was against an undefeated Carwin.  On the other hand Cain's 2 were both against fighters he'd already beaten (though JDS had also beaten him), and Couture's 2 in a row were against the same guy.\n\nAnother common knock against Lesnar is that he had amateurish striking skills.  I don't see this as a strong argument since Anderson Silva had mediocre wrestling, but very few would even attempt to argue that he wasn't the greatest middleweight champ, if not the GOAT mma fighter period.  I'd say it's precisely because Lesnar had limited skill and experience and got by on sheer freakish athleticism (despite serious health issues with diverticulitis) that he was so awesome.  He actually had to cut weight to fight at heavyweight, something only fat guys normally have to do.  I believe that if he was allowed to compete at 300 lbs he'd have had a much better chance of holding Cain down after the takedown, and therefore might have even beaten him for that elusive third successful heavyweight title defense.\n\nAnother consideration is that Lesnar is the greatest draw for the UFC ever, at least on a fight by fight basis.  Some might dismiss this factor, but I think it's also a big part of why Muhammad Ali is almost universally considered a greater hwc than Larry Holmes. \n\nSo in conclusion, ranking the UFC heavyweight champions goes like this imo:\n\n1: Brock Lesnar\n \n2: Randy Couture\n\n3: Cain Velasquez\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Look how guys like Werdum, Arlovski or even Mark Hunt have been able to rise back up the ranks recently.  Good lhw's have always been able to move up and be competitive.  Even all time greats like Cain, and (outside UFC) Fedor have been undersized, and could probably make lhw no problem.  ",

You are saying that Brock Lesnar got by with poor skills (which is impressive) and made an impressive career due to mostly athleticsim. And then there are the Fedor nuthuggers on the other side, saying that Fedor are the best because he won even though he was undersized.\n\nBoth are 100% invalid statements that you should not even consider in this debate. Both fought at HW, end of discussion.\n\nWith that being said we have to look at performances and records alone. And the fact is that Cain got more wins title fights than Lesnar do, and he could still get more as well. And all of Cain's wins in title fights have been very impressive, while I wouldnt consider Carwin an impressive win from Lesnar. Lesnar also fought during a much weaker era of the division according to me. The best talent was spread out in other organisations or still yet in developement (Cain for example.) ",

However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.\n\nCain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.  Couture has more wins in title fights than Cain, especially if you consider his lhc reigns.  Would you consider Couture above Cain?  ",
