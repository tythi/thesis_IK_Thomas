While this doesn't make sense to me, I will admit that it is plausible this is how it happened. What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week, had no means to defend himself while pinned downed in a ground and pound position, which is stated as being an MMA position. What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, \"you're going to die tonight.\" What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?",

You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n&gt;What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, \"you're going to die tonight.\" \n\nWell the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

One headline said \"In the weeks before the shooting,\" but I can't find out exactly what they mean. Let's say that's about a month.\n\nI don't think you can reliably escape mount after 12 mma classes against a stronger opponent in a stressful situation. I don't think you could do so after 12 classes of straight ground grappling where you had spend a fair portion of the time on obtaining/escaping mount. \n\n&gt; What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, \"you're going to die tonight.\" \n\nI'm sitting on your chest, which makes it a bit harder to breath to begin with. I grab your neck with my right hand and pound your head on the ground. I reach for your gun with my left hand. My mouth is still free for trash talking. \n\nI doubt that he would be simultaneously choking and slamming GZ; most likely did one, then the other. If I was choking you and you moved your head forward, I could slam you back down, but you wouldn't want to do that because moving your head forward would put even more pressure on your throat.\n\n&gt; What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?\n\nMaybe he's done more bad stuff than that. Weed was just the only thing he got caught for. \n\nI suspect he probably just wanted to beat up GZ, but once the gun came into play he figured \"kill or be killed.\" ",

A baseball bat is certainly capable of killing someone, and it happened in your house, so in this case you are justified. You didn't even escalate the situation, since the baseball bat was already \"deadly force\", or at least I'd say it was.\n\nIf someone hits you with no weapon, as Zimmerman alleged Martin did, it's absolutely not justified to pull a gun on them.",

If you listen to the full recording, Zimmerman actually says \"ok\" when they tell him that he doesn't need to follow.\n\nAlso, being followed isn't justification for hitting someone. Unless Zimmerman threw the first punch, Trayvon initiated the encounter. And honestly I see no reason why Zimmerman would hit him. What reason does he have? What is the motive?

            "body": "&gt;What doesn't seem plausible to me, is that a man who was taking MMA classes three times a week, had no means to defend himself while pinned downed in a ground and pound position, which is stated as being an MMA position.\n\nTaking martial arts classes doesn't automatically make one a cage fighter. Keep in mind that while he may have been taking some classes, his primary motivation was exercise, not training to beat the snot out of the first kid to look at him the wrong way. He may have been taking classes, but he also presumably had little to no actual fight experience.\n\n&gt;What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, \"you're going to die tonight.\" What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?\n\nWho knows? I'd rather not speculate on what Trayvon may motivated Travyon Martin to do what he did. There are two witnesses here. One is dead and the other can't be compelled to testify.\n\nWhat I do know though, is that the kind of injuries inflicted upon Mr. Zimmerman could very easily be considered life threatening. A broken nose gushes blood and when face up on the ground that blood is going to go straight down the persons throat and into their lungs which can cause suffocation (Mark O'Mara brought this up on re-re-cross this morning). This is why, in the event of a bloody nose, it's best to pinch the nose at the bridge and lean *forward* rather than *backward*. Blood is affected by gravity after all.\n\nFurthermore, trauma to the back of the skull can cause a concussion which can also prove life threatening. A soccer referee was recently killed as a result of being punched in the head by a disgruntled soccer player.\n\nMr. Zimmerman sustained these injuries and all accounts seem to indicate that they were inflicted by Trayvon Martin.",

It was about 100 yards from Trayvon's house, and closer than that to Zimmerman's car, and right about the same spot where Zimmerman initially lost sight of Trayvon, but a few minutes later.\n\nSo, if Rachel is telling the truth and Trayvon made it to right outside his house, he had to double back about 100 yards to make it to the spot where the confrontation occurred.

Also, his MMA training was for a workout, not for self defense.

CMV.\n\nI suggest going down to your local MMA gym and jumping in the ring with a 17 year old kid, especially if you are in your 30s or 40s and long out of shape to see for yourself. Even work your way up to it. Then imagine that you aren't in a ring and no one is there to call time or stop the fight. This is the best way to test your view and perhaps change it.\n\nPeople frequently go to the gym, but just do the cardio workout or shadowbox and don't really spar. There is a tremendous difference between going to the gym and fighting.\n\n&gt;What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?\n\nFrom what I read some of the recent events in Trayvon's life and texts about the subject were full of trash talking about school fights (MMA style) and he had pics of a gun on his phone. What compels Trayvon and many other youths to pretend they are hardcore gangster mother fuckers who will kill to protect their rep? That culture is very old... It was NWA and movies like Boys in the hood that show how that culture is created when I was a kid... and many others since push that way of thinking and that attitude.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how you don't mention any of treyvon's history in your post when you clearly have followed the story. Did you not know he was staying with his dad because he was getting tossed out of school for fighting?",

Of all the people that claim to 'know all about fighting', a very small percentage have actually had any kind of training against a variety of body types.  Of that small percentage that actually train, a small percentage of them get to the level where they can spar with the kid gloves off.\n\nI can count at least 3 instances in the last 3 years in my city where someone has been left dead or a vegetable as a result of getting their head smashed in while fighting.

The other option is hoping this guy attacking you, who is clearly in a superior position, is not going to kill you, and that's not a fair situation to put anyone in.\n\nEven if Trayvon was bluffing with his threat, *even if he didn't make the threat*, legally it's unfair to expect Zimmerman to put his life in his attacker's hands in order to not use deadly force to defend himself.  When he's on the ground with someone strong punching him in the face, he has a totally reasonable fear of harm coming to his person that justifies self-defense.\n\nAlso, I don't know if you've ever been hit hard in the face, but you'd be amazed what one good shot to the face will do to your thought process.  You aren't calmly thinking \"Maybe there's some way I can de-escalate this situation so the least harm is done,\" you're thinking \"OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK.\"   And judging by his wounds Zimmerman was hit multiple times.\n\n",

Of course they may be doing nothing wrong, but you still look fucking suspicious and you have to be intellectually dishonest to say otherwise.    \n\n",

Also, there is NO LAW in ANY STATE that says you cannot follow someone in your own damn neighborhood. So, no matter what you would do or what's street justice, it is fucking assault and battery to physical attack someone you think is following you. \n\nAlso, I'm from the South and down here a lot of us have carry permits that allow us to carry our guns almost 24/7. So, word of advice, don't go around fucking attacking people or you might end up dead. \n\n&gt; Ever had a gun pulled on you? That's pretty much how it goes until the coward builds up enough courage to pull the trigger.\n\nAs to this whopper, no I have never had a gun pulled on me. I try to stay aware of my surroundings and avoid those type of situations. You know by NOT fucking confronting people I think may be following me. ",

Having your head slammed against the sidewalk isn't an easy position to escape from. Even the pros have problems escaping this...\n\n&gt; What seems even less plausible to me is that Trayvon was all at once suffocating Zimmerman, slamming his head against the ground, and reaching for Zimmerman's gun while telling Zimmerman, \"you're going to die tonight.\" \n\nAll at once? Or did it occur within a short amount of time. placing your full weight on someone's diaphragm over a concrete surface is enough to give the sensation of suffocation. This is the position Martin would've been in if he had immobilized Zimmerman.\n\n&gt; What would compel Trayvon, a kid who had really only ever gotten in trouble for smoking weed, to decide to kill a man he didn't know?\n\nNot all homicide is planned or even intentional. Your assertion betrays an assumption of yours that either party was acting with a full read of all available information. Zimmerman and Martin likely had no idea what the other one would do, but being pinned down with your head banged against concrete *is* a life threatening situation.",

            "body": "Facts that pro-Zimmerman people love to ignore:\n\n1 Trayvon Martin's father and his father's fiance were in that gated community. He had every right to be walking around at night and nobody in this thread has ever stated Trayvon committed ANY crime whatsoever.\n\nOn the day Martin was fatally shot, he and his father were visiting his father's fiancée and her son at her townhome in The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, a multi-ethnic gated community, where the shooting occurred.[42][43] Martin had visited his father's fiancée at Twin Lakes several times.[44][45]\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin\n\nImagine if your loved one, a teenager perhaps, was walking in your neighborhood, and a guy like Zimmerman shoots him or her in the chest???\n\n2 The dispatcher told Zimmerman that he SHOULD NOT follow Martin:\n\nDispatcher\n\nAre you following him?\n\nZimmerman\n\nYeah.\n\nDispatcher\n\n**Ok, we don't need you to do that.**\n\nZimmerman\n\nOk.\n\nhttp://bizsecurity.about.com/od/creatingpolicies/a/A-Transcript-Of-The-George-Zimmerman-Police-Call.htm\n\nIf someone, any pro-Zimmerman person could please address the transcript above, that would be great. Was there any reason, after Zimmerman actually acknowledges with an \"OK\" that he hears the dispatcher tell him \"We don't need you to do that,\" that HE STILL FOLLOWS MARTIN. I'd love to hear the reasoning behind this, if anyone is brave enough to come up with something logical, since following someone after the 9/11 person says not to isn't exactly the smartest thing to do. \n\n3 Martin was actually running AWAY from Zimmerman before he decids to follow the kid:\n\nDispatcher\n\n**He's running? Which way is he running?**\n\nAmbient sounds are heard which may be Zimmerman unbuckling his seat belt and his vehicle's \"open door\" chime sounding. The change in his voice and the sound of wind against his cell phone mic indicate that he has left his vehicle and is now walking. The dispatcher seems to pick up on these changes and sounds concerned when he later asks Zimmerman if he is following Martin.\nZimmerman\n\nDown towards the other entrance to the neighborhood.\n\nDispatcher\n\nWhich entrance is that that he's heading towards?\n\nZimmerman\n\nThe back entrance…(expletive)(unclear)\n\nThis section of the recording has been the subject of much speculation. Some suggest that Zimmerman has just made a racial slur, but the audio is not clear.\n\n4 I assume many in this thread have weapons or know how to shoot a gun. Can some of you please explain how if you are getting the snot beat out of you, that you can still take the gun out and shoot?? If the force from Martin was that ferocious, how was Zimmerman still able to get the gun out? \n\n5 Finally, the \"this was a poor man getting pummeled\" defense of a wannabe security guard turned murdered, I'd love to know why:\n\nExpert witness: Zimmerman’s head wounds not life-threatening... “To me, the word ‘slam’ implies great force,” Dr. Valerie Rao said in court. “And this, the resultant injuries, are not great force.” \nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/52379085#52379085\n\nSO WHICH ONE IS IT? Were his injuries not life threatening like the expert above states? \n\nOr was poor George getting so beaten up, that he also had one arm free to pull out the weapon.\n\nZimmerman murdered that young, unarmed man because he was a hyped up, neighborhood watch guy, who could very well killed you or me if he viewed us walking in his neighborhood late at night as a threat. \n\nAnd please, deal with the points I've made above, if you can muster up some level of rationality, or logic. I've even numbered them, so go ahead, I love a good debate. But stick with the points I've made. Thanks. \n",

Neighborhood watch people around the country will think it's alright to initiate confrontations, then claim self defense after murdering innocent people if Zimmerman walks. ",

Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the \"pummeling\"? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that. \n\nAlso, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy). \n\nAlso, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??\n\nAs for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.\n\nConservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:\n\n\"Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.”\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/\n\nFinally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman \"somehow\" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential \"perp\" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem. \n",
