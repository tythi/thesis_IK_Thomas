    "body": "Full disclosure: I've had a bit of a fear of large dogs for most of my life, so that may color my viewpoint a bit. At least large dogs that I haven't gotten to know.\n\nI saw the video, and at [3:22 \\(the moment right before the first shot is fired, so TRIGGER WARNING. Seriously, it does get pretty fucked up afterwards\\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WDBZr4ie2AE#t=202s), you can definitely see the dog jump very close to the cop, easily within a foot, and it looks like its paws made contact with the officer's body. And that dog looks like a Doberman or a rottweiler or something, and a cursory Google search tells me that [they're ranked 7th and 2nd among dog breeds for bite fatalities.](http://www.curiosityaroused.com/nature/top-10-most-dangerous-dog-breeds-based-on-bite-fatalities/) I'm not saying that they're necessarily inherently dangerous, just that the numbers show that they're a serious threat to human life. More cursory research suggests the reason behind the numbers is because of the popularity of these breeds for dog fighting If Hawthorne is an area known for dog fights, then *not* shooting the dog had a very real potential for human fatalities. If any of those cops weren't wearing a protective layer (and I see no reason why they would have, if they're the low-level neighborhood patrol types), they could have easily gotten a huge gaping bite hole in their torsos. \n\nThings the officers did right IMO:\n\n1. Shooting the dog, because it established itself as a threat once it tried to jump the cop. Plus, if it's a breed that's well known for being lethally violent, what should they have done otherwise? I can't think of a way they could have safely neutralized the threat at that juncture, barring a tranq gun or other equipment that the cops probably didn't have. Batons and tasers would be less lethal but (educated guess), there would be a lot more suffering involved. \n\nThings that they did wrong IMO:\n\n1. Letting it suffer like that. Clean shot to the head to put him out of his misery would have made the whole thing not so bad. I'm fine with human euthanasia, too, but only under certain conditions. Seeing the dog suffer was horrible.  \n2. Taking that guy into custody for no apparent reason, other than filming shit on his phone. WTF? Of course the dog is going to try and defend the guy, and the cops should have isolated the threat before making the arrest. Bad police work, and bad legislation too, but that's a different matter.\n\nSo I believe the cops should get in some legal trouble for letting it suffer, and that their incompetence at police work should result in a lengthy unpaid suspension, but the decision to kill the dog became the right one as soon as it tried to jump on that one cop. Judging by the uproar, you'd think the dog was tied to a tree and barking at them harmlessly when they pulled the trigger. Hell no, that motherfucker's behavior was unmistakably threatening. \n\nThe biggest plot hole here is ***what other options were available once the dog started attacking?*** This is the big question, I think, the one most likely to result in a âˆ†. If someone can present a reasonable alternative to shooting a dog that's right at the cusp of actively trying to kill you, I'm all ears. \n\nTasers and batons were a possibility, but were the cops carrying those things? Do they require special training to be used against dogs? Plus, tasers and batons might be *worse* options than a clean shot to the head, because lots of suffering would be involved, survival or not. I'd imagine mace would just piss the dog off even more. ",

I'm admittedly limited in knowledge on tasers and their use in law enforcement, but if TASER Int'l themselves can no longer legally advertise their products as \"non-lethal,\" then I'd hesitate to say they should have gone that route. I'm pretty sure that animal control is equipped with tasers of smaller voltages for smaller animals. But again, I suck at tasers, so if anyone wants to correct me then I'm up for it.\n\nAlso yeah the arrest was unwarranted and legislation to prevent recording of the police is stupid. That's not the issue at hand though. It *should* be the issue at hand, but everyone's all up in arms over the fact that the dog died, not over bad legislation or bad police work.

To what extent should police errors remove their ability to defend themselves and justify that defense?\n\nBut that opens up yet another line of discussion. Example: if a judge was too slow in signing a search warrant, and the people in that house ended up killing someone, should the judge be charged with aiding and abetting homicide?

Everyone knows what's coming yet it still happens, how?\n\n1. The dog's owner is wrongfully arrested.  He's within his rights to speak to the police in the manner he did, and record them.\n \n1. The officers act with unnecessary roughness on a fully compliant man, in full view of the man's mature rottweiler. What did they think would happen? They knew the dog was there.\n\n1.

Well, you probably shoot them to save yourself. It may not even be a reasoned response. Suddenly there's a gun in your face, and you react instinctively to protect yourself.\n\nSo are you a murderer in this scenario? You clearly did not intend to hurt anyone, and you did so only to save yourself. However, you created a scenario where an innocent person died at your hands. Is that murder, manslaughter, reckless endangerment, etc., or should the whole things be dismissed as a case of self-defense (in which case you get charged for breaking and entering, but not for the homeowner's death)?\n\nIt's a very tricky case but, frankly, I would be very surprised if more than a few people think that a thief in this scenario should not be charged for the death of the homeowner. Likewise, I would be very surprised if more than a few people think the cops in the above scenario should not be charged for the death of the dog.",

In both cases, no death was intended, but it happened because the cops/thief recklessly created a dangerous situation.\n\nBy the way, if someone has a gun pointed at you, you have to react quickly; they can kill you in under a second. Real life is not like movies; you don't have showdowns where two people point guns at each other, unless both of those people are idiots. The *first* person to shoot will kill the other *and* avoid being shot themselves, so there is no reason to wait unless you want to die.\n\nThe homeowner would be a nut to not shoot the thief as soon as he sees he has a gun, and the thief would be a nut to not shoot the homeowner as soon as he sees he has a gun.

The simplest option is to push the owner into the dog. Even releasing him or undoing his handcuffs, but most importantly *get him physically between the dog and the police*. Dogs are all about space, and the dog only jumps the officer when it moves *into* his space.\n\n&gt; Hell no, that motherfucker's behavior was unmistakably threatening.\n\nHonestly, this is what I find odd, is so many people feeling the dog was being so threatening. When the dog approaches initially and the officers react, the dog *backs off*. It is clearly confused and concerned for its owner. What is the first thing the officers do? Pull the owner farther away (stupid) and move between the dog and the owner (really fucking stupid). Hell, the dog **smells the fucking ground**, such a clear non-aggressive action to almost be silly.\n\nThe simple act of putting the owner in between the officers and the dog fixes everything.\n\nAlso, one quick correction:\n\n&gt;If Hawthorne is an area known for dog fights, then not shooting the dog had a very real potential for human fatalities.\n\nThis is a bad argument because fighting dogs are typically selected specifically *against* human aggression, for the very reason that no-one (not even dog fighting pieces of shit) want to deal with a human violent 160 lb dog. \n\n",

I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.  \n\nAfter he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.  ",

When he actually started to approach the cops is after he put his dog away when they started approaching him. He lives in an area where this is common, obviously, so he knew he was getting arrested. When they were telling him to come over to him is when he walked over to them and put his hands behind his back before they closed the gap. Shouting in their faces would be a bad move, yes - except he simply didn't do this.\n\n&gt;stop blaming the cops and instead blame this bad dog owner that got his dog shot by provoking the police.\n\nIf he hadn't been illegally detained by the police there wouldn't be a dead dog or any incident. The first time the cops approached this man were to detain him, not to talk to him or to get him to leave. Not sure if you're black living in a poor neighborhood but I have a feeling you live a comfy life and can't sympathize with a situation that simply doesn't happen to rich white kids.",

However, for the majority of my childhood I lived in a number of poor neighborhoods (because my parents couldn't hold on to an apartment for more than a year or two). I grew up in similar neighborhoods and went to school with kids that were a lot like that. I also have a brother who is a cop and I hear about what he has to deal with day in and day out in order to \"protect and serve.\" So as someone who has grown up on one side of this and has a brother currently on the other side let me tell you, 90% of the blame falls on the guy who decided to push his luck with the police.",

The dog was being aggressive, but not attacking. You'll note that when the officer \"calms\" the dog he does so by reaching a hand toward its face. (This is a bad idea.) You'll also note that the officer had his gun out the last time he moved towards the dog. The dog jumped up, but didn't bite. It jumped off him and back to the ground. The officer then backed away and shot a dog that wasn't attacking him.\n\n&gt;Considering that there were people all over the place, causing both a safety hazard and a public relations problem, it might've been a better idea to pull out pepper spray, mace, a baton or try to get a hold of the damn lead...basically anything but shooting a dog in front of half the neighborhood.\n\nThe most important point regarding the dog (arresting someone who irritates you is a separate issue) is that it wasn't attacking.  Dogs are what they're conditioned to be.  A dog develops violent tendencies in harsh, usually abusive environments.  It's also very difficult for them to switch that aggression \"off\" once it's switched \"on\".\n\nMy point there is that if this dog was vicious and ready to attack, it would've done so immediately and with conviction.  It didn't so it probably wasn't going to.",
