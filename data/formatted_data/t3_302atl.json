    "title": "CMV: Hank should have told Dale about his wife's affair with John Redcorn.",
    "body": "In the television series *King of the Hill*, Nancy has an affair with John Redcorn for several seasons. Her husband, Dale, never finds out. Joseph, the son of Nancy and John Redcorn, also never finds out. \n\nI have three related arguments. 1) Hank should have told Dale about the affair and 2) Someone (Nancy?) should have told Joseph who his real father was. \n\nHank is supposedly one of Dale's best friends, and as such should have told his friend about the ongoing constant cheating that was occurring under Dale's roof. Instead, Hank sits back while Dale raises a kid that's not his own, and constantly is made to be a fool while John Redcorn gets to bang his wife.\n\nLikewise, Joseph grows up without any of the knowledge from his native american father, without his real father's advice and traditions. It is likely that one day Joseph will find out that he is half native american - it would be much better if he found this out from his own mother while he had a chance to share his childhood with his real father. Instead, he had to go through puberty and enter early adulthood with only the squirrely Dale as his role model.\n\nThat Hank never tells his best friend tarnishes Hank's character. Hank comes off as a selfish promoter of the status quo with no real maturity to do the right thing. Hank doesn't care about Dale at all, and only puts up with him (and patronizes him) to proliferate the \"peace\" of the neighborhood. But, in almost every other part of the show, Hank is shown to be a mature caring individual who has the resolve to do the right thing no matter what. Not only should Hank have told Dale because that's what best friends do, Hank should have told Dale because it fits his character. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Obviously Hank would prefer Buck not spend all day at a strip club, but because his presence was a negative influence at Strickland Propane, he facilitated Buck being unbanned. \n\nDale is dirt stupid. Despite the affair being obvious to everyone, Dale was under the impression that he was living in a happy marriage. \n\nTelling Dale not only would have destroyed him, it would have torn his family apart. Telling Dale about the affair would have benefited no one. The affair was not harming Dale or Joseph. By Hank remaining silent, the only people hurt by the affair were Nancy and John Redcorn.",

He's had chances (the exterminator played by Sarah silverman). \n\nAlso, Redcorn cares very much for Joseph. He is upset that he wasted the best years of his life with Nancy and other women instead of having a family that he could pass down his tribal traditions to. The reason he's not in Josephs life is because he understands that Joseph is truly Dale's son in all ways aside from biologically. \n\n",

            "body": "You have to put youself into Hank's shoes:\n\n1. Hank personally witnessed Bill's divorce destroy Bill and left him a broken shell of a man. The thing is that as pathetic as Bill was in the present, Bill wasn't always such a loser back then. Dale, from the show's flashbacks, was already portrayed as incompetent, unstable, and well, Dale. Bill became a fuckup because of the divorce while Dale was already a fuckup since high school, if not earlier. Hank probably thought that if a normal person could be reduced to a fuckup because of a divorce, imagine how much more a fuckup would sink lower, which is a likely possibility if Dale learned that Nancy was cheating on him.\n\n2. Remember that episode where Peggy lost her shit because Hank got mono from some random chick back at high school? It was an overreaction because Hank kissing that chick ruined some romantic fantasy that Peggy had over how she and Hank first met or something. And if there is one person who blows things even more out of proportion and overreacts to minor things, it's Dale Gribble.\n\n3. Dale is highly suspicious of anyone, and the few people he trusts are Nancy and Hank. But the thing is that he trusts that they both have his best intentions at heart, not that he literally believes everything they say. It's very likely that even if Hank told Dale, Dale would refuse to believe Hank, think that Hank is telling a joke or not being serious, or believe in any other cognitive dissonant thoughts because as far as Dale is concerned, Nancy will never harm him. I mean, Dale already knows that he is not Joseph's biological dad and that John Redcorn was alone with Nancy on the day that she got pregnant. Part of me thinks that Dale only believed that aliens inpregnate Nancy because the truth of Nancy's infidelity would destroy him emotionally. In the end of the episode, Dale mostly played along with Joseph's suggestion that Dale might be his biological father instead of aliens because of reasons. Hank probably figured that Dale will never believe him anyways.\n\n4. Hank might judge people harshly, but he doesn't impose his values onto other people and rarely interfers with other people's lives. It's not his personality. He doesn't try to push Strickland away from his hedonic lifestyle, he doesn't try to make Cotton not be a bitter old racist, misogynist asshole, and for all his grips over Bobby not being right, he doesn't really micromanage Bobby or force Bobby to be into sports or anything else that would make Bobby \"right.\" Hank's tolerance of lifestyle that 100% goes against his values is contrasted with Peggy's constant attempts at trying to meddle into other people's affairs even though she is ostentatiously tolerant of other people's lifestyles.",

I still think he should have told him, or Bill, or Boomhaur, and the way the show leaves Dale never finding out leaves a poor taste in my mouth, but I can begrudgingly give a delta for convincing me that Hank's character is one that is quite live-and-let-live unless it brings harm to his family or lawn. I'd say I'm half convinced, but half not, but since I can't get a half-delta I'll be fair and give a whole one âˆ†",

John Redcorn obviously cares little-to-none about his son, Dale loves him like his true son, all of the relationships between the above are stable and would be thrown into a tornado if the secret got out.\n\nIf we are to look at it from a utilitarian perspective (that being that in a moral decision, the outcome that leads to the highest possible NET happiness is the most moral one), then it is clear that Hank should have not told him anything.",

            "body": "First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on \"the white man\". \n\nDale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons. \n\nSo it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people. \n\nWe also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.   \n\nAlso, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.\n\nAnd as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion). \n\nHe also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in \"ignorance is bliss\" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well. \n\nIf Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice).

            "body": "I have been waiting for this. One episode showcases very well why he shouldnt. The one where Peggy finds out. See she was in your shoes or the shoes any of us would be in: she is angry and wants Nancy to get her comeuppance because not only was it moral, but she sort of would enjoy seeing what would happen. Now, I am sure we can agree that anyone else in this situation it would make sense to out it all. But Dale is still a very cartoony aspect in Arlen. He has guns, dangerous killing chemicals, and paranoid tendencies constantly on the brink of sanity. Would You tell that guy the truth? He would go fucking INSANE. He would very likely murder them all then his self. Thats point one. Point two, do you think Dale is unhappy? The show makes it a point to display how much Dale truly loves his wife and son, because even though he doesnt make a lot and needs Nancy just to live somewhat normally, he does everything he can for that kid! And this goes into point three, Joseph is Dale's kid, he isnt John Redcorns anymore. Why? Well, when Peggy goes to tell Dale everything in the episode, Joseph approaches and asks for five bucks for a movie for him and bobby to rent. When Dale checks he has two fives, and he says \"5 for you, 5 for me!\" and as the kids leave he giggles and says to Peggy, \"Watch this, Hey Joseph! I found another! Cant watch a movie without milk balls can you?\" And proceeds to hand him the second five. Why are these details important? Because despite his mental illness and poor lifestyle, he still knows how to bring a smile to his sons face anytime, which Nancy learns when Dale wins her back. The reason why nobody said anything for years? Because Dale is a great dad and even though Nancy wasnt close at the start, Dale and Joseph were and it would have ruined both their lives. Dale would find out the woman he loved had been cheating on him with his \"best\" friend, thus sending him into a psychotic rampage, and Joseph would have lost any security that was in his family. His parents would likely split up though he would go with Nancy who would probably go to John Redcorn, then all that fucked up dynamic would begin. Dale would be institutionalized. Now, you say because Joseph is Johns son, he deserves to know. That is definitely true, and maybe one day, when he has moved or when Dale has died and Joseph is smart enough to notice he is a different color, maybe Nancy will tell. Here is the big thing though: in a much later Thanksgiving episode and for many episodes, John Redcorn struggles with losing his son and wanting him back, but the point made is John wasnt there for Joseph, and Dale was. While Dale was raising the kid, Nancy and John fucked, thus losing any opportunity they had to redeem themselves before getting in too deep. so later, when the tables turn and John feels remorseful, it doesnt matter. Things are too far gone, and it becomes very unfair for John to ruin Dales life just because he fucked up twelve years prior. Lastly, even if Hank had spoken at the start, you would get similar results. See one detail we forget: John Redcorn had MULTIPLE bitches when he met Nancy and was known for being aloof, as seen when he takes Bills one true romance that should have worked. We would have two Bills then, not Bill and Dale. And, in that if Redcorn bailed after him being Josephs father came out, Nancy would have been alone to raise the kid, who would always know about his father, and probably never his real father. Long story short, Hank doesnt say anything because while it seems morally right, he would still be responsible for a very genuinely happy Dale who loves his family going over the edge and having his life ruined.",
