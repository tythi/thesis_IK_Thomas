    "body": "When I say over, I mean the new roll comes out in front like [this](http://imgur.com/kCiVqkc) as opposed to the [under](http://imgur.com/A3jzMiV) orientation.\n\nIt is so much easier to pull down more squares with the roll coming over. Every time I come across an under roll, I usually end up have to do a complete 360 until I can find the start. Not only does this waste time, it just seems unhygienic to have to touch the whole roll, or have to reach around just to grab hold of it. I used to think people were just lazy when loading a new roll and didn't look at the orientation, but the other day I heard someone say they always place the roll the other way. \n\nCan someone who prefers their toilet roll in the \"under\" orientation please explain the appeal and convince me that the \"over\" way is wrong?",

I've heard cats do the same thing.\n\nThe under orientation is advantageous in the event you have a small child or animal who likes to bat at the roll because it doesn't unroll. The over orientation ends with the entire roll in a pile on the floor at my house.",

As soon as you introduce children or animals, under is better. Not only does it prevent the unrolling of a roll on the floor but it also slows down your child from using the entire roll when they're being potty trained.\n\nUnder provides substantially more control.",
