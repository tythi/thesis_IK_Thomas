Tell us what experiences you've had outside our subreddit, either recently or in your lifetime, that made you think \"**This Changed My View**\". Give us your stories in the comments!\n\nYou can consider these questions to help get you thinking:\n\n* Known or met someone with an interesting ideology or opinion that caused you to reconsider your own?\n\n* Had an experience, good or bad, that changed your perspective?\n\n* Learned something new that challenged what you believed?\n\n* Ever have your tastes or interests changed?\n\n* Read an article or seen a video that got you thinking differently?\n\nAnd just as a reminder, comment discussions here are not debate-oriented, so there's no obligation to take opposing sides in conversations here (in other words, Rule 1 does not apply here).",

Up to this point I had been very much against any kind of intervention in Syrian \ncivil war. While I'm still in the air seeing the press release he linked made me reconsider and I'm now leaning towards it being the right thing to do.",

I used to be firmly against religions, I still am at some level but it made me consider it. Now I kinda believe in some sort of silent random reincarnation thy has nothing to do with any god, any type of karma, soul or whatever. I just think somehow you'll get to live another life at some point with no connection whatsoever of the latter lives.",
