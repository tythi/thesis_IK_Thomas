    "body": "Steve Harvey seems to have a solid head on his shoulders. He has become successful without (seemingly) selling out. It appears he still remembers where he came from and who has helped him along the way. And I think he may be one of the best family feud hosts since Richard Dawson. \n\nMy friend... Hates my opinion with a passion and thinks Steve Harvey is of the devil.  Why?\n\nChange my view ",

He basically tells you that as a woman, it's your responsibility to keep men intrigued, and that if you are to fall into your own desires, you're less of a \"keeper\".\n\nHe also believes that anyone who doesn't believe in God has no moral compass and is an \"idiot\".\n\nsource: http://youtu.be/az0BJRQ1cqM\n\nI apologize. This is my first CMV response, and I'm not very good a wording an argument.",
