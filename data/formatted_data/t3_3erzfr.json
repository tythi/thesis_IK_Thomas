    "body": "This player debuted for the Southern Stars (Australian national cricket team) at 16, making her the youngest player to make the national side (male or female). Just a month later she debuted for Matildas (Australian national soccer team). She was fast-tracked into the national cricket team having not even played for her senior state side. In her debut T20 international match she was awarded Player of the Match, a feat she repeated in the world T20 final; scoring 3/18. In just her third year of international cricket she earned her maiden 5-wicket haul and despite being a defender she scored a goal in the 2008 Asian Cup; just her second year (so as a 17 year old) of international soccer.\n\nShe is now 24 and has gotten 2 of Australia's 3 wickets against England so far (match is about a third of the way through) after Perry scored 67 off 58 bowls.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

He set the world record in 5 different events (200 m freestyle, 400 m freestyle, 800 m freestyle, the 4x100 m freestyle, and the 4x200 m freestyle).  At his prime, he was considered the best swimmer in the world, and even now he is listed among the best to ever have existed.",

            "body": "*Note I'm not anti-women or online troll\n\nI'm sorry, but male and female sports athletes can't be compared.\n\nAny of the top 50-150 male ATP players would beat her 9.5 out of 10 times, there are huge differences in the sport.\n\n1. The average serve for at the 2015 Wimbledon Finals for a Female(I saw the stat during a Semi-Final game) was 94MPH while the males was 124MPH. That's a huge difference, the fastest ever female serve was 131 while the males fastest serve was 163MPH, Cilic, Groth, Karlovic, Raonic, and Roddick all of those players average first serve is above [124MPH](http://heavytopspin.com/2011/10/13/us-open-serve-speed-by-player/).\n\n2. Females play best to 2 sets and men play best to 3 sets\n\n3. It was tested in Battle of the sexes tennis game where Bobby Riggs(Former number 1) at age 55 played 30 year old Margrett Court(Ranked 1 at the time) and she lost in straight sets. Note he latter played King age 26 who beat him at age 56,(He couldn't get any drop shots, but still forced a 3rd set.)\n\n4. Serrnia said in 1998 at the age of 16 that she could beat and male under 200, Karsten Braash responded ranked 203 that he would play her, and she accepted and lost (6,1 6,1)(Note: She won the US open in 1999). Venus then challenged him and lost (6,2)(6,2).\n\nBaraash said he played like a 600th ranked player to keep the game fun.\n\n\nAlso the whole Female World Cup players should be paid the same is total BS in my opinion for two reasons\n\n1. The Female World Cup was projected to bring in 26M viewers while the Male World Cup brought in 800M-1B people(Note: That some countries don't have good reporting standards so the numbers are off.)\n\n2. The Female World Cup brought in $40M Ad revenue while the 2015 male World Cup brought in $4B which is 100x more and thats why the Mens side is paid more.\n\nIn my opinion its insulting to women to pay them the same as the male tournament if they didn't earn it.\n\nIf they want the same tournament winnings they should be advocating for a single tournament not two different tournaments. The same with Tennis if you want to compare Serrna to the male version you should be pushing for a single tournament.\n\nYou cant say female athletes are better, because they dont have the same ability as men, do to physical ability.\n\nYour watching her compete againist women and since shes good you expect her to do as good againist men, but that never happeans the 2015 US Womens team lost to the top Mens High School Team in the country.http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/uswnt-vs-u-17-usmnt.1939180/\n\n\nThe 2010 Canada Womens Team(Won the gold medal that year.) Played in the Alberta Tripple Midget AAA Hockey League and came second last. Note they played 1/2 the amount of games, but even if they won the remainding half they still would of came in 3rd-4th.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2014/06/05/the-billion-dollar-business-of-the-world-cup/\n",
