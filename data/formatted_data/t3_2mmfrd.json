    "body": "Back in the late 90s and early 2000s I always wanted to go to Space Camp (the official NASA one in Mobile, Alabama). I used to see commercials for it on TV and they made it look like the coolest, most fun thing ever. However, my parents would always tell me that I couldn't go whenever I asked them about it. I don't exactly know their reasoning for it (they used to tell me that I could go if I got good grades and then tell me that they never said so) but in any case, I feel like should have gotten to go.\n\nBasically there's only one way to change my view. Convince me that Space Camp wasn't all it's cracked up to be. (I'm thinking it might be significantly lamer now than it was back then due to budget cuts, but I want you to convince me that it sucked back then)\n\nArguments about my parents' wishes aren't going to convince me by the way.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Space camp seems to cost currently between $700-1000, plus there's the cost of flying you there and back, and probably some ancillary costs too.  It's hard to say your parents should send you on what is a fairly expensive vacation if it would make them unable to pay the mortgage.",

It was no different. we had some \"space\" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.\n\nI don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.\n\nthe education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the \"experience space training\" was basically rides we could only go on twice.\n\nthe gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3415/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)\n\n [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http://www.allaboutent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gyroscope-ride.jpg)\n\n the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_64wjUxIOxTc/TNAuIK0CqZI/AAAAAAAAAUA/AjHjkse2HSI/s400/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun. \n\n\nwe met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee/human waste catcher and played a \"prank\" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.\n\nobviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it\n\nwe were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days\n\nwhen i went home, i told my parents it was great.\n\neven as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.\n\n\n\nI feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.\n\nwe spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nMaybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.\n\ni believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team. \n\n\n\ni don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.\n\ni don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste. \n\n\ntl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a \"i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value.",

I'm not sure I can call it a field trip because I'm from Indiana and we went over the weekend. The group of students who went were people who wanted to go so it wasn't for a class. On the trip we buddied up with someone else and that person ended up being a good friend of mine throughout high school and I still keep in touch with him (I am one year out of college). \n\nHaving said all of that can you say that your trip would have ended up the same way or better? My enjoyment was due to the school trip and buddy system that was complete luck in it's pairing of myself and my friend. I also only remember two things about the entire weekend trip, which probably totals 20 minutes. My area of study and my career do not reflect an early interest in space or rocketry. Considering all of this, it is a nice memory but I cannot say my life is enriched by the experience. I have an interest in space now but that comes from other areas such as Neil Tyson, sci fi movies, and recent scientific events.\n\nI'm not saying it sucked back then like you want me to say but apparently it wasn't that great because I don't remember all that much about it. If your interest in science is making you reflect and wish that you went (you don't really give a reason), there are ways to get similar effects. Go to the National Air and Space museum in D.C. and watch an educational film in iMAX and there's most of Space Camp right there.",

You only got to do a tiny bit of what you hoped and only a few kids got to do the fun stuff (and only for a few minutes).  Spending a day walking through the museum was the best part by a large margin.  I still enjoy that when I pass through Huntsville.\n\nTo put this into perspective, I entered a trivia contest at DragonCon in the late 90s.  I tied for 2nd with two others.  The top 3 got to have a play off with the top prize being a trip to adult Space Camp.  The 4th place prize was a $50 gift certificate to a local used bookstore.  I volunteered to take 4th because I preferred the gift certificate to the trip (and the second and third prizes).",
